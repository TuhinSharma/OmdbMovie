When she explains the situation, Fred forgives her, and they get married. For a while they live happily in a modest home. But the situation gets complex when Winfield, who owns the house, comes by to collect a delinquent payment and suddenly dies. Dearie, afraid that Fred will not understand what really happened, gets a boarder and her cook to help her hide the body. At midnight they carry it down the stairs to the countryside, but Fred hears their steps creaking on the stairs. All seems lost when the police find the body and the suspicious Fred finds Winfield's hat under a couch. He opens Dearie's private trunk and discovers the fancy clothes that Winfield gave her. Fred goes after Dearie, furiously chopping with an ax through the closet door behind which she is hiding. Dearie persuades him to listen and explains that she had kept the clothes only because she thought Fred would admire them, and that in fact Winfield died from a heart attack.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Rupert Julian","Released":"10 Feb 1919","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Creaking Stairs","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Evelyn Campbell, Rupert Julian","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

But he is only a smallholder's son, and when he asks for Aslaug's hand, her father just laughs at him. Instead her father wants Aslaug to marry Ola Thormundson, a gawky boy, who is the son of the wealthiest farmer in the village. Aslaug brings her family's cattle to the Husaby summer farm up in the mountain. Only one road leads to the summer farm, and it passes right by the main farm. When Tore returns from a visit to Aslaug in the mountains, Knut and his sons beat him black and blue. As it's impossible for him to use the road anymore, Tore has to figure out another way to go to Aslaug. Next Saturday he crosses the fiord in a rowing-boat. He stops at a fifty meter high wall of rock, and starts climbing it, hoping to reach Aslaug at the top.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Rune Carlsten","Released":"26 Dec 1919","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"65 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Sweden","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Dangerous Wooing","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Sam Ask, BjÃ¸rnstjerne BjÃ¸rnson (novel), Rune Carlsten","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

By some artifice of shrewd legal aid, Merritt manages to seize Harry's ranch under a bogus writ of foreclosure. Failing to get justice by his many letters to Merritt, \"Cheyenne Harry\" goes east and calls at the millionaire's mansion. At first, Merritt refuses to see him. Then, to cause amusement for his daughter, Helen, and her guests, he invites the \"uncouth\" westerner into his dining hall. He is sure that he will make some grave error in table deportment and afford them all a laugh. To the amazement of Merrit and the guests Harry's table manners are faultless. Then, to trick him into an embarrassing position, Merritt eats with his knife. Harry, realizing that it is proper for the guest to follow the example of the host, does likewise. He leaves the house chagrined but more determined than ever to get justice from Merritt.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"John Ford","Released":"29 Nov 1919","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"50 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Gun Fightin' Gentleman","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Harry Carey (story), John Ford (story), Hal Hoadley (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

In the household she meets Daniel's sister Dolores, the neighbor Dr. James Dunwoody who loves Dolores, and his son Roland, who is under suspicion. Betsy pretends to be tough, but when she sees a ghost emerge from the chapel, she screams. The result is that Dolores locks her in at night. The following night, Betsy climbs out of her window and sees the ghost again, this time in the graveyard. After some intrepid investigating, she finds that playing certain chords on the chapel organ cause a door to open, leading into a passage to a tomb. Betsy bravely pursues the ghost who turns out to be Daniel, though he has become deranged. Further, she discovers that he is actually desired by the law as an international forger.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Fred Niblo","Released":"25 May 1919","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Haunted Bedroom","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"C.

Gilmore), the father and wealthy Wall Street magnate -- it's his spoiled, headstrong daughter Catherine (Virginia Pearson). She is so willful that she has earned the name \"Impossible Catherine,\" and her whole focus in life is to prove women's superiority over the masculine gender. Catherine is pretty successful in this endeavor until she runs into Yalie John Henry Jackson (William B. Davidson). He's read The Taming of the Shrew and believes he can out-Petruchio her Catherine. First he takes the feisty lass up in a plane and after a few tail spins, suggests she either marry him or jump. She marries him, of course, but then runs away. He finds her and takes her to his Canadian ranch, where he sets her firmly in the kitchen. But none of this tames her spirit until one day he is wounded while trying to protect her -- and this is the one thing that's always guaranteed to get the girl. It works on the wayward Catherine who decides that Jackson is her hero.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"John B.

It is the annual fair in Holstenwall. Francis and his friend Alan visit The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, an exhibit where the mysterious doctor shows the somnambulist Cesare, and awakens him for some moments from his death-like sleep. When Alan asks Cesare about his future, Cesare answers that he will die before dawn. The next morning Alan is found dead. Francis suspects Cesare of being the murderer, and starts spying on him and Dr. Caligari. The following night Cesare is going to stab Jane in her bed, but softens when he sees the beautiful woman, and instead of committing another murder, he abducts her. Jane's father awakens because of the noise, and he and some servants follow the fleeing Cesare. When Cesare cannot outrun his pursuers anymore, he gently places Jane down on the ground, and runs away. Francis and the police investigate the caravan of Dr. Caligari, but the doctor succeeds in slipping away. Francis pursues the fleeing Dr. Caligari, and sees him disappear into a madhouse.

When warned by Captain Jack of the Texas Rangers of impending trouble, elderly rancher Bill Burrel swears that Mexican cattle rustler Pancho won't do any riding or shooting in the area again. Pancho's lieutenant Santas, (who desires his boss's daughter Juanita's hand, and has been refused), overhears Burrel and decides to make things rough on Pancho by stirring up trouble for both sides. Pancho and his raiders, sworn to drive the settlers off the border country, attack the Burrel ranch and shoot Burrel dead, and his son Harry swears to make Pancho pay for his night's work. In the conflict that follows Pancho is knocked unconscious and his hands crushed in a press by masked men, apparently Texas Rangers. Though the torture is actually performed by the traitorous Santas and his cohort Rodriguez, Pancho blames the Rangers for the injury, swears revenge, and the two factions resolve to destroy each other. In succeeding chapters, Pancho and his ruthless gang menace Harry, his sweetheart Ruth and abduct Harry's younger sister Blanche, inflicting fiendish and deliberate tortures upon them. Pancho's demands are carried to his sworn enemies by the black-garbed \"emissary of evil\" the Masked Rider, who rides onto the scene without warning to kidnap, assault, or fire upon the Texas Rangers, their relatives, and even their horses. Pancho's daughter Juanita, frequently harassed by his men, is shocked by her father's cruelty and takes surreptitious action to prevent his murdering innocent captives when she can. She also falls in love with Captain Jack of the Rangers, which complicates matters even further. Rugged and outspoken \"Ma Chadwick,\" Ruth's mother, helps the Rangers when Blanche and then Ruth are both kidnapped. Interesting shooting locations include a hacienda complex in Sabinas, Mexico, an ancient mission in San Antonio, the gigantic Medina Dam, at which a terrific action sequence was apparently almost thoroughly improvised (the scene does not appear in the original shooting script), and the \"hole in the wall,\" a labyrinthine passage through the border mountains.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Aubrey M.

His efforts to swat the insect only spray ink over his drawing, so he borrows a fly-swatter from a co-worker. When the fly comes to rest on the clown, the cartoonist gives the paper a mighty whack, sending the clown head over teakettle, but missing the fly entirely. The clown borrows the pen from the cartoonist and attempts to smack the fly, which only splatters the cartoonist with ink. The clown next decides to draw a picture of a bald man to lure the fly, but once again his mighty thwack only sends the seated man sprawling. Exasperated, the cartoonist picks up the paper, and the ink slides down the page into the inkwell. In the last scene, the fly follows the ink into the bottle and the cartoonist captures the annoying insect at last.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Max Fleischer","Released":"04 Oct 1919","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"4 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Tantalizing Fly","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Max Fleischer","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

W. Griffith's epic Intolerance, Denmark's greatest director, Carl Theodor Dreyer (The Passion of Joan of Arc, Vampyr), was inspired to make his own four-episode historical epic with each story told end to end, anthology-style, linked by theme to the others. The unifying character, Satan, attempts to win God's favor but is doomed to cheerless participation in dark episodes of human history: the temptation of Jesus, the Spanish Inquisition, the French Revolution and the Russo-Finnish war of 1918. Few directors resisted compromise and convention the way Dreyer did; fortunately, the Nordisk Film Company was artistically progressive by Hollywood standards and agreed that this should be a prestige film made to the highest standards. More than two years in production, Dreyer not only directed but also controlled every facet of this ambitious production.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.5","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Carl Theodor Dreyer","Released":"24 Jan 1921","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"167 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"438","tomatoFresh":"4","Country":"Denmark","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Leaves Out of the Book of Satan","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"05 Apr 2005","Writer":"Edgar HÃ¸yer (scenario by), Marie Corelli (from a novel by)","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"60"}

Sir George goads Jekyll into visiting a music hall, where he watches the alluring dancer Gina. Jekyll becomes fascinated with the two contrasting sides of human nature, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of separating them. After extensive work in his laboratory, he devises a formula that does indeed allow him to alternate between two completely different personalities, his own and that of a brutish, lascivious person whom he names Hyde. It is not long before the personality of Hyde begins to dominate Jekyll's affairs.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"92","tomatoUserRating":"3.4","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Awards":"N/A","Director":"John S.

Bill agrees, but when they reach the farm, they are locked in a room by a lunatic and forced to remain there overnight. When they finally escape the next day, the two are hard-pressed to explain to their respective mates where they have spent the night, until a doctor comes along and explains that the lunatic was his patient and that he will pay damages for their inconvenience.

The two are turned away at the door, and the mother takes her young daughter to the barn to sleep. The farmhand Jon discovers them in the morning but the mother has not made it through the night, so young Anne is taken in and raised by the family. She is a rambunctious little girl, always getting her younger (step) brother into trouble. Finally mother Storlein has had enough, and lets slip that she never should have taken Anne in. Young Anne goes to Jon and learns the truth of her arrival at the farm. Years pass, and she and her younger step-brother are now smitten. But Jon, the farmhand who found her in the barn all those years ago is also in love with Anne.

When she has an accident and is forced to recuperate at the minister's house, he has to hide her in order to avoid even more of a scandal. Mazie Darton, a high-wire performer with a traveling circus, longs for a peaceful country life. Forced to stay in a small town while laid up with an injury, Darton is spurned by the conservative townspeople. Rev. Jonathon Meek, the local parson, befriends the circus troupe, especially Darton. But he, too, opens himself to criticism from his flock, who protest his closeness with the show people. Eventually, Darton's boyfriend arrives and the pair become closer.

But Alma has designs on Conrad and tricks Sylvia into a compromising situation when he arrives, and he abandons her. Disheartened, she returns to Piney Woods to help a reverend running a school for young negroes. Sylvia learns that the reverend hasn't the heart to turn away poor students, and unless he can raise $5,000 to supplement the $1.49 per child per year that the state supplies, the school will be closed. She goes up north again to try to raise the money and has little success, but meets kindly negro, Dr. V. Vivian, who helps her regain her stolen purse. When she saves a child from being hit by an auto, she herself is slightly injured. But the owner of the car is philanthropist Mrs. Elena Warwick, who is sympathetic to her quest and promises to donate the $5,000 to the school. Her bigoted southern friend, Mrs. Stratton, tries to talk her out of the donation, and Mrs. Warwick gets so incensed she raises the amount to $50,000. Her job done, Sylvia returns to Piney Woods. But Dr. Vivian has fallen in love with Sylvia and goes to Alma to try to find her. There he learns the shocking details of her past and that of her family.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.4","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"Oscar Micheaux","Released":"12 Jan 1920","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"79 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"383","tomatoFresh":"3","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Within Our Gates","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Oscar Micheaux","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"51"}

The most important of these changes sees Hamlet made into a female character - a princess forced to masquerade as a man by her scheming mother; from this follows Hamlet's secret passion for Horatio and rivalry with Ophelia for his love. Queen Gertrude is here presented as conspiring in her first husband's murder, and the old king's ghost does not appear - young Hamlet merely hears a voice from the tomb and (apparently) dreams of him. In addition, Hamlet now kills Claudius (in a fire) immediately upon returning from Norway with an army led by old school- friend Fortinbras, and it falls to Gertrude to engineer Hamlet's death in the fencing match as well as kill herself by accidentally drinking the poisoned wine.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"79","tomatoUserRating":"4","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Svend Gade, Heinz Schall","Released":"08 Nov 1921","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"131 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"135","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Germany","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Hamlet","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Erwin Gepard (manuscript), E.

His mother died traveling in steerage. This leaves little Jackie Blair alone when he appears at Ellis Island, and the immigration officials want to send him right back. Captain Bill appears on the scene asking for a job - but he's too old and no one wants him. He sees lonely little Jackie, pities him and asks the eight Pinkosuwitz children to include him in their games. Thus, the Captain unwittingly engineers Jackie's escape. The orphan is mixed in with the Pinkosuwitzes when they leave the immigration building. When they find they've gained a ninth child, they send him on his way. This leaves Jackie to follow Captain Bill back to his very modest home - for which the old salt is unable to pay the rent. Jackie tries to make himself useful. He even sings and dances with an organ grinder to make money for the Captain's medicine. Little does either guess that Jackie's wealthy grandmother has everyone in immigration looking for the boy. When Jackie turns up at the matron's party for unfortunate children, he may be reunited with her.

Several years later, the mother comes back to reclaim her child, but Marie, not wanting to give up Jeanne, tells the mother that the child is dead. When Belgium is invaded in 1914, Marie fears for Jeanne's safety and sends her, now a teenager, to America along with a letter to Jeanne's mother confessing Marie's deception. On the trip, Jeanne picks up two young Belgian orphans and takes them with her. Jeanne finds her mother living on a large estate, and is repeatedly denied the chance to explain who she is. She ends up taking a job as a maid in her mother's mansion, and claiming the two orphans as her own.

Simplex sees through Oil-Can's plans, sets out to expose them and this raises Laura's already-high level for contempt for Simplex even higher.

But that $10,000 windfall could be long gone with the arrival onto the scene of Kid Ryan, a boxer with the strength of an ox and who is Jim's assistant's ex-cell mate. Kid Ryan and the assistant hatch a scheme to swindle Jim out of that money by the assistant convincing him that Kid Ryan is a fake, and that he should enter into a boxing match with the Kid, betting that $10,000 on himself to win.

Koko climbs it and disregards a sign that warns him against continuing, but only because Max urges him to go higher. Koko leaves planet earth and enters another world. He meets up with an angry giant that has an enormous head and a relatively tiny body. Koko escapes by jumping back to earth, where he slams painfully into the ground. Koko vows revenge. With a rubber stamp, he creates an army of self-duplicates. Marching in formation, they leave the drawing board and head toward the cowering cartoonist.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Dave Fleischer","Released":"15 Dec 1922","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Jumping Beans","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Red uses her cart, which is pushed by her little dog; the cart gets a flat tire, and she inflates a donut to replace it. A wolf (a human lothario) drives by in a flivver, and dashes off to grandma's house, where he finds a note saying she's gone to the movies. He shrinks his car and stashes it in his pocket, then waits for Red, who stopped to watch a dancing flower. Red arrives, and they go into the house, where he attempts to have his way with her. The dog rushes off and gets help from an airplane pilot, who uses a skyhook to remove the house and, ultimately, lift the wolf in his car and drop him in the lake.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Animation, Family","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Walt Disney","Released":"29 Jul 1922","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"6 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Little Red Riding Hood","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Charles Perrault (story), Walt Pfeiffer","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

They plan on selling him the one across the way from Hutter's own home. Hutter leaves his innocent wife, Ellen, with some friends while he is away. Hutter's trek is an unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, which most attribute to the plague. Hutter himself tries to rush home to save his town and most importantly save Ellen from Nosferatu's imminent arrival. In Wisbourg, Ellen can feel the impending darkness as Nosferatu gets closer. But she learns that a sinless woman can sacrifice herself to kill the vampire. Will Hutter be able to save Ellen either from Nosferatu and/or her self-sacrifice?","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"97","tomatoUserRating":"4","tomatoConsensus":"One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel -- and a chilling performance from Max Shrek as the vampire -- set the template for the horror films that followed.","Genre":"Horror","Awards":"1 nomination.","Director":"F.W.

O'Neil takes Alvarez's place at a masked ball. Alvarez, in turn, robs the old Padre (John Herdman) of some pearls and stabs him to deal with O'Neil's knife.

The engagement is celebrated with an extravagant party at his estate, which is a gigantic palace and park in oriental style. His son Eduard arrives from Cambridge, accompanied by a priest, who is his tutor. The priest is disgusted by the bacchanalian reveling and womanizing going on everywhere. Mary's adorer, the sculptor Harry Lighton, tries to convince her to break the engagement. When she refuses, he shoots himself and is seriously injured. Mary falls asleep and is transported in her dream to the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. In the dream she sees herself as the wife of Lot, leaving her husband to play a central role in the excessive rites of the goddess Astarte. An angel arrives and leads Lot and his wife out of Sodom, just when the city starts to collapse. Lot's wife cannot resist looking back, and is because of her disobedience converted into a pillar of salt. The dream opens the eyes of Mary, and when she wakens, she leaves the party and hastens to Harry in the hospital.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Michael Curtiz","Released":"26 Mar 1923","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"150 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Germany, Austria","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Sodom und Gomorrha","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Michael Curtiz, Ladislaus Vajda","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The widowed Rupp falls in love with a former aristocrat, Helen, now down on her luck and pawning her last heirloom. He proposes marriage and she accepts in order to save her ailing mother who needs a monetary influx to avoid death.

Meanwhile, Graf, a shyster, arranges purchase of a near bankrupt auto manufacturing firm, Phoenix, to Rupp's great advantage with practically no monetary recognition to Graf, who swears revenge. Rupp comes upon his son begging Helen not to marry his father but to return to Platen. Rupp misinterprets the scene, thinks his son is after his intended, and banishes him. The last twenty minutes involve an auto race and its aftermath. Fred unknown to all becomes the driver of his father's rival auto maker. Platen is driving for Rupp's firm, Phoenix.

Mary stops by for some lemonade, while nearly charming the boys out of their socks. As the daughter of a horse owner, she manages to sneak them inside the track to watch the race. The whole thing is terribly exciting; and it gives Mickey an idea. The gang quickly abandons the idea of selling food and drink. Instead, they create their own race track. Of course, their own derby day is not quite like the adult version. Instead of horses, one boy has a cow, another a mule; a third rides in cart driven by a goat and a fourth in a dog-driven cart. Farina, whose vehicle is a tricycle, spikes the water of some of the animals beforehand. Before the race is through, the animals will be too drunk, lazy or overworked to finish. The horse race becomes a foot race.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy, Family","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Robert F.

After one of their fights where Silas as usual draws the short straw, his wife sends him out to buy some fish. For the money she has given him and some money he has put aside himself, Silas decides to go on a drinking bender. But he dares not return home without fish, and therefore decides to combine the business of fishing with the pleasure of drinking, and borrows a small boat with some fishing tackle in it for this end. Then he sets out on the Oslo-fjord. Silas has no luck fishing, but succeeds admirably in getting drunk, finally falling asleep. He then dreams the main storyline of the movie: In the boat he comes to the small island of Kavreingen - one of the many small islands in the Oslo-fjord. Treasure-hunters, a blood thirsty pirate and an unknown beauty cross his path, but Silas defeats all obstacles except one: His hash wife suddenly shows up on the island. The unknown beauty, with whom Silas has fallen in love, disappears without a trace, and Silas's wife solves that mystery with some striking arguments.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"O.

The movie is set at the beginning of the NEP (New Economic Policy) in December, 1921. A mysterious radio message is beamed around the world, and among the engineers who receive it are Los, the hero, and his colleague Spiridonov. Los is an individualist dreamer. Aelita is the daughter of Tuskub, the ruler of a totalitarian state on Mars in which the working classe are put into cold storage when they are not needed. With a telescope, Aelita is able to watch Los. As if by telepathy, Los obsesses about being watched by her. After some hugger-mugger involving the murder of his wife and a pursuing detective, Los takes the identity of Spiridonov and builds a spaceship. With the revolutionary Gusev, he travels to Mars, but the Earthlings and Aelita are thrown into prison by the dictator. Gusev and Los begin a proletarian uprising, and Aelita offers to lead the revolution, but she then establishes her own totalitarian regime. Los is shocked by this development and attempts to stop Aelita, and then reality and fantasy become confused, and Los discovers what has really happened.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"100","tomatoUserRating":"3.2","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Yakov Protazanov","Released":"25 Sep 1924","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"6.8","Runtime":"111 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"1,738","tomatoFresh":"5","Country":"Soviet Union","tomatoImage":"fresh","Title":"Aelita: Queen of Mars","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"20 Jul 1999","Writer":"Aleksei Fajko, Fyodor Otsep, Aleksei Tolstoy (play)","Production":"Film Arts Guild","Language":"Russian","tomatoUserMeter":"55"}

Mrs. Stanlaw is told by gambler Richard Steele that her daughter is lost. Flash forward 10 years; Riley and Dexter are running a prosperous gold mine, and Steele has just come to town to run the local saloon. Ruth, meanwhile, has grown into a beautiful young woman, and finds herself falling in love with Dexter. Between Steele sending his henchman Pierre to kill Dexter, Dexter discovering that Steele tried to kill him on the ship, and the reunion of Mrs. Stanlaw and Ruth, there's plenty of drama even without the dramatic Alaskan scenery, including the majestic glaciers.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"71","tomatoUserRating":"3.5","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"Lewis H.
