The Duke and Steve fight again, and everyone rushes out of the cave. Mr. Rockface notices his pot of food is empty; earlier, Wild Willie the Missing Link had eaten it. Mr. Rockface tells the three suitors they will have to procure their own dinner. Steve locates a desert quail and shoots an arrow at it, but the arrow misses the quail and happily (for Steve) hits The Duke's behind. Meanwhile, Wild Willie is still hungry and goes hunting for snakes. He finds a dinosaur's tail instead, and when he tries to eat it the dinosaur kills him. Luckily, Theophilus witnesses this scene; after the dinosaur leaves he stands on the dead monkey-man, as if triumphant. The others arrive and are shocked that Theophilus apparently has slain the terror of the countryside.

Rameau is inconsolable and keeps the room that Conchita died in inviolate, visiting it only on the anniversary of his wife's death. Twenty years later on one of these visits he discovers, among one of Conhita's letters, proof that she had been unfaithful to him and that Pamela, the girl he had raised from an infant to womanhood, was not his child. The shock drives him out of his mind, and he drives Pamela from his home, refusing to ever see her again.

Later, while Wag has a semi-friendly encounter with a cat, Dud spies an old gentleman smoking a pipe. The gentleman falls asleep and Dud steals the pipe. \"Here's where I make Pittsburgh look like a million dollars worth of sunshine!\" he tells his dog. He smokes the pipe and his exhalations form the face of the old gentleman, then a beautiful woman, then the words, \"You're a bad boy.\" Dud laughs at this, but then the smoke turns into a demon-like spirit who aims to fix him good. The spirit grabs Dud and lifts him high into the air. The distraught Wag is soon up to his neck in a flood of his own tears. Meanwhile, the spirit hooks Dud onto an unfriendly crescent moon. Dud cheers up the moon by telling him a joke, but the moon laughs so hard that he knocks off Dud, who falls back to earth.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace A.

Fifteen years later Von Herbeck tells the Grand Duke he has found the Princess, and produces the coat, locket and Hildegarde as proof. Meanwhile, the real Princess has been abandoned by the gypsies and adopted by peasants, and has grown up as a \"Goose Girl.\" The young King Fredrick of Jugendheit is officially betrothed to the fake Princess but he does not wish to marry a woman he has never met. He disguises himself as a Vinter and travels around the countryside, meets the Goose Girl, and rescues her from the insulting attentions of a vicious Count, and longs to marry her.

Gussle outsmarts them by attempting to hand over his goods by stretching across the stream, but dropping the goods into the water thereby making the robber also fall in. He makes his way to an inn and recounts his experiences to the other guests and then they all go out and spend time playing in the snow.

Hart) and \"Wind River\" (Herschel Mayall) are robbed, at gunpoint. After the surprise, they track Maitland down, and Keno shoots him dead on self defense. Keno goes through his belongings and finds a letter and a locket; the letter announces the arrival of the deceased's sister, and the locket has a cameo picture of Doris Maitland (Margaret Thompson). Thus, Keno tells Wind River they must do a heap of lying. Meeting the girl at the stagecoach's arrival, Keeno feels responsible for the innocent and attractive Ms. Maitland; he tells her a white lie, that her brother was a good man, \"killed in a mine accident,\" who had left her a cabin and money - and Keno turns his own cabin over to Doris. Keno and Doris began to fall in love. Anita (Louise Glaum), a dance-hall girl, aggressively tries to seduce Keno. Keno repels her, and later, the dance-hall girl catches sight of her rival when Keno muses on the cameo. Anita decides to expose his lies to Doris in a private conversation at the cabin. First, Doris gets into a fight with the saloon girl but then Doris accepts the painful truth. Furious, Doris confronts Keno outdoors, and his admission of having killed her brother is followed by her sending a bullet into his body. Keno, disillusioned, wounded, staggers back to the Double Stamp, asking Wind River for his saddle bags so he can ride out. But not far from town, as he lays dying, Wind River tells Doris all the facts about her brother. They find Keno, and Doris nurses him back to health.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Crime, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"William S.

He is greatly impressed when his friend, Dr. Pennison Crisp, successfully grafts a paw from one cat onto another. Mortmain's engagement to Bella Forsythe is complicated by the fact that she is the ward of his friend, banker Gordon Russell, to whom he owes money. Worse, Russell is also in love with Bella. Russell causes Bella's brother, Tom Forsythe, to disgrace himself, and forces Mortmain into bankruptcy. Mortmain rashly says that he would like to kill Russell, but this is overheard by Flaggs, who works for Russell's lawyer. Mortmain then hears that Russell has been murdered, and in shock he faints and injures his hand. Dr. Crisp anesthetizes Mortmain with ether, which causes hallucinations, and creepily tells him that although he must amputate the hand, another can be grafted in its place. Tom Forsythe, who is suspected of the murder, agrees to Crisp's offer of $10,000, but dies during the transplant. Crisp now grafts Tom's hand onto Mortmain's arm. Mortmain gradually goes insane as Flaggs blackmails him and Bella is now afraid to be touched by him. The hand goes crazy! Mortmain awakens from his ether-induced dream to find that Tom's hand is choking Flaggs...","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Theodore Marston","Released":"06 Sep 1915","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Mortmain","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Marguerite Bertsch, Arthur Chesney Train","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

In it, Oxilia spins a variation on the Faust myth, embodied here by the diva Lyda Borelli. Typical of extravagant D'Annunzian aestheticism at its height, Rapsodia Satanica was one of the summits of what was later called the \"tail coat film.\" Diametrically opposed to the \"cinema of reality\" practiced by Serena, Martoglio and others, \"tail coat films\" set their melodramatic stories in the salons and villas of the upper middle class and the aristocracy, deploying narrative structures contrived to showcase their actors and especially its actresses. This had the effect of accentuating their physical presence and turning them into stars - probably the first stars in movie history. The success of the \"dive\" contributed to the development of motion picture grammar in its special use of the close-up.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"67","tomatoUserRating":"3.3","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Nino Oxilia","Released":"01 Jul 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"40 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"15","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Italy","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Satan's Rhapsody","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Alberto Fassini (screenplay), Alberto Fassini (story), Fausto Maria Martini (poem)","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"67"}

Margherita Gautier è una mondana alla moda. Bellissima, si distingue dalle colleghe per l'aspetto ed i modi. Ha per amanti uomini ricchi ed influenti e cambia spesso accompagnatore. Una sera, ad una festa, conosce Armando: è un colpo di fulmine, dalla travolgente passione. I due vanno a vivere insieme, fuori città, ma, dopo qualche mese, il padre di Armando, preoccupato per l'avvenire del figlio, interviene, supplicando la donna di lasciar libero il figlio. Margherita, che ama veramente e per la prima volta in vita sua, si lascia persuadere, e scrive ad Armando di aver deciso di rompere la relazione. Il giovane, sentendosi tradito, per vendicarsi la insulta durante una festa. Così Margherita cerca di stordirsi, ma il vortice dei piaceri non serve a far dimenticare; le emozioni e il dolore per il distacco dall'uomo che ama, finiscono per logorare la sua salute, e la donna muore di tisi pochi mesi più tardi, dopo essersi riconciliata con Armando sul letto di morte.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Baldassarre Negroni","Released":"08 Jan 1916","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Italy","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"La signora delle camelie","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Alexandre Dumas fils (novel), Baldassarre Negroni (adaptation)","Production":"N/A","Language":"Italian","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

One day, an inventor and his associate dine in the restaurant and is served by the waiter. Gaining access via a submarine moored offshore with its ready crew, the inventor and his associate plan to rob a passenger steamer of a large shipment of gold on board. As they seem so secretive, the waiter devises a system of listening in on their conversation without being detected. As such, the waiter learns their plans to rob the steamer. Using a naval disguise, the waiter plans to take their place first on the submarine so that he can rob the steamer himself. Even with the help of the submarine's crew - or in spite of it - the waiter finds that stealing the gold and getting away scot-free isn't as straightforward as he anticipated.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"57","tomatoUserRating":"3.6","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Charles Avery, Syd Chaplin","Released":"26 Dec 1915","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"24 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"49","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Submarine Pirate","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Mack Sennett","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"57"}

(1915) was a series of twelve three-reel dramas, released between March and July 1915. Henry King and Ruth Roland starred in each episode, playing different roles each time, with a variety of supporting players who varied from one episode to another. Each episode told a complete and individual story, but they were all inter-related by a uniform theme. Although there were no cliff-hanger endings, each episode did, in fact, end with a challenge to the audience: Who was responsible for the misfortune of the principal characters? The titles of the twelve episodes were: #1: The Price of Fame; #2: The Pursuit of Pleasure; #3: When Justice Sleeps; #4: The Love Liar; #5: Unto Herself Alone; #6: Houses of Glass; #7: Blue Blood and Yellow; #8: Today and Tomorrow; #9: For the Commonwealth; #10: Pomp of Earth; #11: The Fruit of Folly; #12: Toil and Tyranny.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Harry Harvey, H.M.

He abandoned her and a sailor on a mysterious island and has come back after all these years to see if she is still alive and if the nightmares he has will stop.

Joan saves Fergus, however, after which Don is killed by one of the workers whom he habitually mistreated.

Denby is actually a jewel smuggler and sells a $200,000 pearl necklace. Ethel notices her necklace is gone upon her arrival in New York and claims her insurance money. The insurance company inspector finds the behavior of Ethel's sister very peculiar and has her investigated by Taylor, a customs inspector. She soon reveals that she is the thief. Taylor tells Ethel he can forget the whole story if she helps him frame Denby. Ethel agrees and does it. As he is about to be taken to jail, Denby offers Taylor $30,000 to release him. Taylor accepts. Denby reveals himself a secret service agent in charge of catching a customs inspector who has been dealing illegally with smugglers for three years: Taylor. Ethel eventually marries Denby.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Robert G.

On a walk, they meet some gypsies, who show Sally a \"magical ring.\" Giles buys it for her, and Sally comes to believe in its power when her wishes -- such as for a new dress and shoes to wear to the Earl's party for the villagers -- come true, although actually Giles is responsible. At the party, Sally accidentally discovers the note from the Earl and realizes who Giles really is. She determines to reconcile father and son, and begins visiting the Earl each day to play chess and distract him from the pain he suffers from gout. The gypsies tell her that she can find an herbal cure at Devil's Cliff, but when Sally doesn't return home, a search party finds her lying unconscious by the herb. The Earl is upset to hear of her accident and goes to visit her; when his horse goes lame in the village, he unwittingly borrows one from his own son for half a crown.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"Maurice Tourneur","Released":"09 Nov 1914","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"54 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Wishing Ring: An Idyll of Old England","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Owen Davis (play), Maurice Tourneur (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Her father refuses to let him marry her, though, unless Lopaka can bring him two feather cloaks from a rare bird. While searching the mountains for the bird, Lopaka encounters a dying priest of Pele who sells him a wishing bottle in which Kono, the god of the volcanos, is confined. The priest warns him of the dangers of the bottle: if he dies still owning it, he will be damned, and the only way to get rid of it is to sell it for a price smaller than was paid for it. Lopaka agrees and wishes to be rich, then marries Kokua and sells the bottle. All is well until Lopaka contracts leprosy. To get rid of it, he must acquire the bottle again, and he is forced to buy it for the smallest coin of the realm! To save her husband's soul, Kokua is ready to sacrifice herself by buying the bottle for a smaller French coin. Fortunately, a wicked sailor appears with a still smaller Chinese coin and becomes its final owner when the bottle is lost at sea. Lopaka's wealth vanishes, but he is happy to be with Kokua.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Fantasy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Marshall Neilan","Released":"26 Mar 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"50 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Bottle Imp","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Charles Maigne, Robert Louis Stevenson (short story \"The Bottle Imp\")","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

He and his partner, Peter Clay, modeled the dummy after a janitor in their building. While the inventor's daughter is in love and engaged to Clay, the janitor pines for the daughter. A misunderstanding breaks up the partnership, and Tinker forbids his daughter from marrying his now ex-partner. But the daughter hopes a possible lucrative purchase of the dummy from a vaudeville company will be the impetus for her father and Clay to mend their differences, and for them again to be married. The janitor, who sees this rift as an opportunity, hatches his own plan to be near the one he loves, the plan which involves him taking the place of the dummy. Not wanting to blow his cover, the janitor keeps on masquerading as the dummy even after the sale to the vaudeville company. A life-like dummy with a mind of his own on the loose has its own consequences.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Herman C.

For his attempts he needs platinum, but the funds run out because the factory owner Van Haaften has lost his money in stock-speculations. Luckily for Jan, he finds a farewell letter in the park, including a large sum of money. Meanwhile, the owner's son Leo confesses his love for Jan's daughter Annie, but Van Haaften forbids their marriage. Because of Jan's nephew Willem Berg's ongoing spying attempts to gain knowledge of the secret recipe, Jan buys Van Haaften a gun to defend himself against the villain. One night, as Willem has secretly entered the factory, Van Haaften enters his office to find a letter from a friend with a sum of money, that is not nearly large enough to cover his losses. He writes a suicide note and shoots himself, after which Willem enters the office and steals the money and the note. When, on the following morning, Jan has finally succeeded in rediscovering the recipe and goes to show the result to Van Haaften, he finds him dead. With all circumstances against him, he is thrown in prison, but he manages to slip his daughter Lilly the just-discovered recipe. While Willem's attempts to gain hold of the recipe get more and more violent, Lilly tries to gather evidence of her father's innocence. When she has finally succeeded, she sends off a letter to her sister Annie, who by now is guarding the recipe. With the recipe she goes on her way to Lilly, but is chased by Willem...","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Maurits Binger","Released":"09 Mar 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"70 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Netherlands","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Secret of Delft","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The Grey Seal/Jimmy Dale and the Weasel come together there but neither can find the papers and, following a struggle, the Weasel makes his get-away. Jimmy Dale also leaves before the police arrive.

That night he is visited by the spirit of Joan of Arc and is transported back to the 15th Century. Joan's career begins when, as a peasant girl, she meets Trent's ancestor, also an English soldier, fighting for the Burgundians. After Trent is captured, Joan is brought to the attention of the beleaguered Dauphin, heir to the French throne, who cannot be crowned because the English hold the royal city of Orleans. The weak Dauphin is impressed by her vision and apparently heaven-sent powers which border on the supernatural and ultimately gives her command of the armies. She is victorious at Orleans and the new King is crowned. Joan resists Trent's entreaties of love and continues her struggle to free the rest of her country from English occupation. Sinister forces, both English and French, conspire against her and she is captured.

Dora, a young woman, and her family are saved from an Indian attack by a Mormon community traveling to Utah. They join the wagon train. Dora is pursued by two men, one a recent convert, the other a scheming elder with a stable of wives. The Mormon elder wants her in his harem. When the mother kills herself from revulsion toward polygamy, the daughter must consider her own future and the man she loves. One of Mae Murray's few surviving films, this was intended by Robert Leonard to be a thoughtful drama about the goods and evils of Mormonism, but today it is generally considered pure anti-Mormon propaganda.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, History","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Robert Z.

S. Senator Frank Deering has spent his life trying to alleviate the misery of child labor. Judge Vernon, his closest friend, aids him in this struggle. Unexpected circumstances force Judge Vernon to borrow money from Henry McCarthy, one of the factory owners most responsible for the harsh and inhumane working conditions. Judge Vernon is unable to pay off the loan, and is reduced to accepting a bride from McCarthy. Later, the Judge is stricken with a heart-condition but, on his dying bed, he confesses the shameful act he committed to Deering. To keep his friend's name unsullied, Deering makes a deal with McCarthy and votes against the child-labor-act he sponsored. His colleagues and the world, unaware of his sacrifice, mock and jeer him.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Frank Lloyd","Released":"08 Jan 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"50 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Price of Silence","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"M.

Brown takes the dead man's clothes and papers and is able to pass himself off as a good citizen in 1850's Calaveras County. When Lawrence's sister dies, her daughter spends the little money she has to journey to California and live with her uncle. Arriving at the isolated cabin, she realizes he is an impostor, but his threats intimidate her into silence. Lacking money and protection, she immediately becomes vulnerable to the advances of the largely all-male population, and so must acknowledge Brown publicly as her uncle in order to continue to receive food, shelter, and his protection. Over time, this understanding of mutual convenience turns to affection, and he pledges to reform. When former members of his gang continue their dishonest ways, however, the now rehabilitated Brown falls under the suspicion of the local vigilante committee.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"20","tomatoUserRating":"2.9","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Cecil B.

Tom and Polly watch fascinated as the dis-embodied Hand writes (in flashback scenes, mostly.) Cronin and Professor Duvam wait in an adjoining room. The Hand writes that it (he) was a member of \"The Black Seven,\" a psychical and scientific research group in Paris and, because other scientists considered them crazy owing to their advanced theories, they and their meetings were kept secret. Five of these men were the victims of \"The Voice\" (also dis-embodied) in previous chapters, the sixth was Dr. Reynolds and the seventh was Emil LaRoux. The latter, not content, with proving astral bodies could be projected, was also convinced he could recall a soul at will, providing that the body in which the soul had lived on earth was preserved by a certain ancient process. The other members were convinced that no one would consent to being mummified alive. But LaRoux learned that he could easily dominate the will of Reynolds' wife, Irene. He told five of the members he had found his subject for the experiment. The one he didn't tell was Reynolds. A year later, deep in the heart of the African jungle on an expedition and in Reynold's absence, LaRoux made Irene his experiment victim, and left the camp with her mummified body and her infant child. In pursuit, Reynolds found LaRoux's dead body in the desert sand, with a note in his hand saying he had sent Irene's mummified body back to civilization to the five members not on the expedition and the baby son was to be the channeled means of communication with her in what LaRoux called \"The Living Death\". That night Reynold's was bitten by a snake and his servant cut off his hand to save his life. Later, a human arm was grafted to Reynolds' body and he discovered when his astral body was projected, only the missing hand was visible. He now had his method of revenge.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Stuart Paton","Released":"18 Mar 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Voice on the Wire","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Eustace Hale Ball (novel), J.

The 1918 Armistice has ended the Great War, and one American soldier is especially anxious to be discharged. This leaves him vulnerable to a woman - named Miss AWOL - who drives into his camp in a car marked \"Joy.\" Miss AWOL beckons the soldier to join her for a ride, and he does. She hits every possible rock during their ride then barely avoids toppling over a cliff. A policeman on a motorcycle spots them and takes chase. Soon the soldier is in court, and one Judge Gloom fines him twenty-five dollars. Outside the courthouse, Miss AWOL beckons him to go for another ride. This ride is wilder than ever: she flips the car into the air, drives up a tree, hits farm animals (including a cow whose wingéd ghost departs its body), smashes into a haystack (from which dozens of people, for some reason, fly out) and tears a barn from its foundation. Finally, they hit a tree, thus ending the thrill-ride. Immediately, Miss AWOL spots a handsome passerby, and she walks off with him, leaving the soldier to nurse his wounded pride. Meanwhile, the other soldiers at the camp are discharged, and they leap for joy as they depart. The joyriding soldier returns, but finds himself in the guard house. He angrily rattles the bars on his window, but they tauntingly form the word \"AWOL.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Animation, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Charles R.

Tolsztoj gyönyörû regénye, a Karenina Anna is ezek közé a mûvek közé tartozik - csak film idáig tíz készült belõle. A regénynek világszerte leg- ismertebb változata 1936-ból való.

It is gradually revealed to be a snow ball gun. It is replete with a scope that Fido looks through to comment on their aim (\"too high,\" \"too low\"). They successfully knock the top hat off a passing gentlemen two times in succession. Then they hit a washer woman in the head. She pursues them, getting pelted as she approaches the snow bank. Bobby and Fido take flight, pulling the gun on a small cart behind them. The washer woman runs after them. They climb a hill leaving marks in the snow. The washer woman follows. They fire at her as she approaches them. Somehow, she stumbles and falls, and rolls down the hill becoming enveloped in snow and becoming a large snowball herself. Bobby and Fido follow. The washer woman rolls up to their house, hits it, and emerges from the snowball frozen stiff. Bobby and Fido enter the shot, and Bobby runs into the house. He douses the washerwoman with multiple pails of hot water until she gradually resumes movement. In the cellar, the washing woman dismantles the gun with an ax, and feeds the wood into the mouth of a furnace (which chews it). Bobby and Fido, sitting on the stairs in the foreground, express dismay.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Earl Hurd","Released":"21 Jan 1918","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Bobby Bumps' Disappearing Gun","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Earl Hurd","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Tommasso hopes to marry his model Rosa, but her father, restaurant owner Pietro, wants her to find someone more settled and money-conscious, such as the greengrocer Lombardi down the street. Tommasso, he says, throws away his money, such as for a pair of tickets to take Rosa to the opera to see his famed cousin. After the opera, the cousins cross paths in the swanky Galeotto's restaurant, but when neither recognizes the other, Tommasso is generally mocked and Rosa believes him a liar and unworthy. Tommasso must recover his reputation and make a sale, preferably the Caroli bust to his cousin, in order to win Rosa back.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Edward José","Released":"24 Nov 1918","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"50 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"My Cousin","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Margaret Turnbull (screenplay), Margaret Turnbull (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

John and Alice Clayton take ship for Africa. Mutineers maroon them. After his parents die the newborn Tarzan is taken by a great Ape, Kala. Later the boy finds his father's knife and uses it to become King of Apes. Binns, the sailor who saved the Claytons and who has been held by Arab slavers for ten years, finds the young Tarzan and then heads for England to notify his kin. A scientist arrives to check out Binns' story. Tarzan, now a man, kills the native who killed Kala; when their chief is killed the black villagers appease Tarzan with gifts and prayers. The scientist's daughter Jane is carried off by a native, rescued by Tarzan (who has burnt the native village), aggressively loved by him (\"Tarzan is a man, and men do not force the love of women\"), and at last accepts him with open arms.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Adventure","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Scott Sidney","Released":"27 Jan 1918","Website":"http://www.tarzanlordlajungle.com/","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"73 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"80","tomatoFresh":"3","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (novel), Fred Miller, Lois Weber","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"20"}

Her father, a prosperous merchant, was preparing to send her to the West to be educated. For centuries the Armenians had been terrorized by the Turks, but this was a period of serenity between the Turks and the Christian-Armenians. However, the War had hit Europe, and the Turks had informed the American ambassador, Henry Morganthau, in Constantinople, that the Armenians were giving support to the Turks' enemy, Russia. Despite Morgantheau's objections, the Turks issue a decree that the Armenians must be moved southward into the desert. The Turkish governor, a Pasha, comes to Aurora's father and demands she be given him as a bride. The father tells him his daughter will not give up her Christian belief, as she would have to do to marry a Muslim. The governor leaves in anger. The order is given for the removal of the Armenians. The men are separated from the women, and the Armenian soldiers are forced to disrobe and dig a trench, and then are shot down by the Turks. Mothers are torn away from their children and the Armenians are marched away into the desert where, famine, thirst and fierce heat await them. Aurora escapes to a mission school ran by Edith Graham, an English girl. The Turk soldiers surround the school and Miss Graham protests under the protection of the English flag to no avail,as the Turks trample the flag, and the Armenian girls are dragged away. Miss Graham, determined to help the girls as much as she possibly can, disguises herself as one of them and joins the march.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, History, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Oscar Apfel","Released":"19 Jan 1919","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Auction of Souls","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Aurora Mardiganian (book), Henry Leyford Gates (book), Frederick Chapin","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}
