Margherita Gautier è una mondana alla moda. Bellissima, si distingue dalle colleghe per l'aspetto ed i modi. Ha per amanti uomini ricchi ed influenti e cambia spesso accompagnatore. Una sera, ad una festa, conosce Armando: è un colpo di fulmine, dalla travolgente passione. I due vanno a vivere insieme, fuori città, ma, dopo qualche mese, il padre di Armando, preoccupato per l'avvenire del figlio, interviene, supplicando la donna di lasciar libero il figlio. Margherita, che ama veramente e per la prima volta in vita sua, si lascia persuadere, e scrive ad Armando di aver deciso di rompere la relazione. Il giovane, sentendosi tradito, per vendicarsi la insulta durante una festa. Così Margherita cerca di stordirsi, ma il vortice dei piaceri non serve a far dimenticare; le emozioni e il dolore per il distacco dall'uomo che ama, finiscono per logorare la sua salute, e la donna muore di tisi pochi mesi più tardi, dopo essersi riconciliata con Armando sul letto di morte.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Baldassarre Negroni","Released":"08 Jan 1916","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Italy","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"La signora delle camelie","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Alexandre Dumas fils (novel), Baldassarre Negroni (adaptation)","Production":"N/A","Language":"Italian","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

One day, an inventor and his associate dine in the restaurant and is served by the waiter. Gaining access via a submarine moored offshore with its ready crew, the inventor and his associate plan to rob a passenger steamer of a large shipment of gold on board. As they seem so secretive, the waiter devises a system of listening in on their conversation without being detected. As such, the waiter learns their plans to rob the steamer. Using a naval disguise, the waiter plans to take their place first on the submarine so that he can rob the steamer himself. Even with the help of the submarine's crew - or in spite of it - the waiter finds that stealing the gold and getting away scot-free isn't as straightforward as he anticipated.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.6","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Charles Avery, Syd Chaplin","Released":"26 Dec 1915","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"24 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"52","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Submarine Pirate","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"21 Nov 2006","Writer":"Mack Sennett","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"67"}

(1915) was a series of twelve three-reel dramas, released between March and July 1915. Henry King and Ruth Roland starred in each episode, playing different roles each time, with a variety of supporting players who varied from one episode to another. Each episode told a complete and individual story, but they were all inter-related by a uniform theme. Although there were no cliff-hanger endings, each episode did, in fact, end with a challenge to the audience: Who was responsible for the misfortune of the principal characters? The titles of the twelve episodes were: #1: The Price of Fame; #2: The Pursuit of Pleasure; #3: When Justice Sleeps; #4: The Love Liar; #5: Unto Herself Alone; #6: Houses of Glass; #7: Blue Blood and Yellow; #8: Today and Tomorrow; #9: For the Commonwealth; #10: Pomp of Earth; #11: The Fruit of Folly; #12: Toil and Tyranny.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Harry Harvey, H.M.

He abandoned her and a sailor on a mysterious island and has come back after all these years to see if she is still alive and if the nightmares he has will stop. The daughter has been found by five survivors of a Union Army Balloon that crashed near the island. At sea, Professor Aronnax was aboard the ship 'Abraham Lincoln' when Nemo rammed it and threw the Professor, his daughter and two others into the water.
