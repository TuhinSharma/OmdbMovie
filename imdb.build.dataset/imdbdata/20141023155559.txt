He suspects she loves another, and watches to find out who his rival may be. A Prussian spy has been tracked to the mansion, and the Count has reason to believe that he is the favored one, as he sees him enter her window. Following, the Prussian is hidden by Lady Florence in a closet, when the Count enters. He accuses her; she denies even on oath; but the Count detects her anxious look toward the closet. Considering it undignified to search, he plans a more subtle means. Calling two of his lieutenants, he pretends to test a new revolver, using a panel of the closet as a target, still giving her Ladyship a chance to present her lover; but she is obdurate and denies his accusation. Her Ladyship dispatches her maid to the upper floor to remove the trap door above the closet, but too late, for the shots are fired, and when the closet door is opened the sad truth is revealed. This is a subject most beautifully staged and acted with convincing discretion, as well as photographically perfect.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The subject opens with the return home of Prince Dimitri, who meets the maid Katusha, a little peasant girl, and is instantly charmed with her beauty. Young, artless and innocent, as pretty as a rose, she unwittingly fascinates the prince. His noble bearing likewise impresses her, and his little attentions flatter her, until at length she is unable to resist his advances. The poor girl is meted the usual fate. An alliance is out of the question. The disparity of their ranks even forbids it, and soon the prince must cast her aside. Five years later we find that the girl, who is now a loathsome sight, has learned the bitter lesson of the eternal truth, \"The wages of sin is death.\" It is death to the soul at all events. She has gone down to the lowest depths and is arrested in a low Russian tavern. As she is carried to the tribunal she passes Prince Dimitri, who now sees the terrible result of his sins. He grows repentant and attempts to plead her cause before the jury, but they are a callous lot and pay no attention to the arguments for nor against, and by force of habit vote to send her to Siberia. She is dragged out to the pen of detention and herded with a lot of poor unfortunates, who scarcely bear any resemblance to human beings. The repentant prince determines to give up his life to right the wrong he has done, and visits her here with a view of turning her now vicious nature, handing her a copy of the Bible. She does not recognize him at first, but when she does she flies into fury, beating his body and face with her fists and the book. He leaves her and she sits moodily on the bench with the book on her lap. Shortly she turns its pages and lo, the Resurrection! Her eyes fall on the passage (John xi, 25), \"And Jesus said unto her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live.\" In an instant her whole being changes. There is hope for her salvation, and she reads on. The guards arrive and we next see her with the poor unfortunates trudging over the snow-clad steppes toward the goal from whence few return. She becomes the ministering angel, sharing her comforts with them. The prince, meanwhile, has secured her pardon and hastens after her. Giving her the welcome notice, he begs her to return with him as his wife: but no, she prefers to work out her salvation helping those poor souls to whom a kindness is an indescribable blessing, and bidding him farewell, she renounces the world for the path of duty, so we leave her kneeling on the snow at the foot of the Holy Cross.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

'Broncho Billy' Anderson","Plot":"This subject is a correct picture story of a once famous California hold-up. Two out-laws, one an Englishman, the other a Mexican (both well known for their daring robberies and their phenomenal success in eluding the sheriffs and their deputies) plan to rob a certain stage supposed to contain valuables and money amounting to a considerable fortune, The method always pursued by the Englishman in his nefarious work was to become acquainted with travelers, and ascertain the amount of valuables they carried. The opening, scene shows the Englishman mixing with the travelers as they are boarding the stage coach, wishing them a pleasant journey and making his adieux; then the stage driving away. The bandit then meets his confederate, the Mexican, and they mount their horses, and together they take a short cut and head off the unsuspecting travelers. After relieving the occupants of the coach of their valuables, the bandits remount their horses and escape. A messenger is at once dispatched to the nearest town, and the sheriff notified of the robbery. The latter mounts his horse, rounds up his deputies, \"swears in\" a number of cowboys and starts in pursuit of the daring duo. In the meantime the two bandits return to the home of the Mexican and divide their ill-gotten gains. During the division a quarrel ensues, owing to the Englishman claiming the larger part of the spoils. The Mexican draws his knife, but his companion is too quick for him, and after forcing the Mexican to drop his weapon, picks up the most valuable articles and departs. Stung by the humiliation and enraged by the unfair treatment of his companion, the Mexican follows, bent on vengeance, but too cowardly to attack his late comrade openly. He springs upon him as he is changing his clothing and after a severe struggle fatally wounds the Englishman, robs him and escapes. The man revives; struggles to his feet; staggers to the road and intercepts the sheriff and his posse. Acknowledging his guilt he names his confederate and falls dead at the feet of the sheriff. Remounting his horse, the sheriff and posse start in hot pursuit of the surviving bandit. The Mexican espies the posse from afar, and securing his mount leads his pursuers a most exciting chase over mountains, through trackless deserts, bristling with cacti and sage brush, and after a running pistol duel is finally lassoed from his horse and brought to justice.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Gilbert M.

Vinuella, Miguel's wife, resents his action by leaving with them. This sends Miguel into a fury, but still obdurate, he allows them to go, saying that he can get along without them. Now comes the crucial condition. He must have a housekeeper and so sends his servant to engage one. The first is a Chinaman, and to eat the food served by him is impossible. Next an Irish girl. She burns his chops. Finally a cowpuncher. He cooks a steak you couldn't cut with a chisel, and Miguel refuses to eat it. This incenses the cowboy, who becomes a veritable tornado of uproarious, volcanic, ferocious exacerbation, that the poor ranchero is anxious for his life. This cyclonic, fire-eating Bombastes Furioso pulls a couple of guns and puts bullet holes in everything, besides otherwise wrecking the place, and leaves the trembling ranchero more dead than alive from fright. Miguel makes his way disconsolately and sheepishly to his daughter's and son-in-law's cabin, where he finds them seated enjoying a peaceful repast. The savory aroma from the well-cooked viands is too alluring and he at once relents for the sake of a hearty meal.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Flamant, a typical roué of the French nobility, is surrounded by all the pleasures and pastimes his fabulous wealth can procure, but still at times he suffers extreme weariness and disgust for the toadying sycophants about him, so in quest of diversion he visits the art rooms, just as a young girl enters with a magnificent piece of sculpture and places it on sale. The roué is so impressed with the work and the girl that he purchases it at once and follows her to the atelier, where he learns that she is the maid of the sculptress, whom he sees and at once falls passionately in love with her as only a man of his type can, but when he learns that she is totally blind, his feelings change to one of deepest pity, which is, we know, the kindling of pure love. He arranges with her to sit for a bust of himself and when it is finished he declares his love for her but she realizes her condition and rejects it, although she has by intuition come to love him deeply. As he leaves the studio crestfallen she sinks down and for the first time feels the enormity of her affliction, sobbing she cries: \"Oh!

It happened thus: Mrs. Leffingwell has been favored with a visit by some friends in the early evening, and they departing, one of the ladies forgot her muff. Mrs. Leffingwell runs after her with the pulse warmer, overtaking her at the street door. Their second meeting conjures up renewed thoughts of gossip and they spend quite a time, for these are woman's happiest moments, in ibis regalement. In the interim a gentleman burglar enters the apartment and, thinking the coast clear, starts in to work at once. He, by skillful manipulation, manages to open a small safe in which .Mrs. Leffingwell keeps her money and jewels. He has scarcely procured the booty when the approach of someone startles him. Finding there is no means of escape, he puts the loot in his pocket and determines to brave the situation by subterfuge. To this end he reclines in an easy chair and feigns sleep. Mrs. Leffingwell is startled on her entrance at seeing this stranger, who appears to be the same when he sees her, pretending to have gotten into the wrong apartment. She is about to let him depart, when she discovers the safe open, and so, by enticing glances and invitations, induces him to remain. She then engages his attention while she slyly pulls the bellcord which brings her butler, whom she dispatches for the police, and when our gentleman friend is confident he has made a tremendous hit with his hostess two stalwart policemen enter and take him into custody, restoring, after a search, her money and valuables.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Hank Hopkins and Cynthia Stebbins were ardent lovers, matrimonially inclined, and while Hank was a proper sort of a chap, old Dad Stebbins looked with disfavor upon his suit for the hand of Cynth. Their clandestine meetings were nearly always interrupted by ubiquitous Dad, until, in desperation, they resolve to elope. The momentous evening arrives and Hank signals to fair Cynthia, who is waiting In her room, dressed and ready to fly with her hero Hank. Although of a romantic turn, they have not selected Spring as the season to enact the episode, the weather being decidedly hibernal, and so Hank arrives clothed in a heavy hat and long ulster. Hungry Henry, the hobo, butts in on the scene at this moment, and from a distance casts covetous glances at the aforesaid ulster, and when Hank goes to procure a ladder he follows and with one fell swoop knocks out Hank, taking his ulster and hat, leaving him bound and gagged. Back he goes to complete the romance, which had begun so beautifully that it would be a shame not to consummate. Wrapped up in the ulster, with hat pulled over his face, the hobo might easily be taken for Hank by one less nervous than Cynthia, so she descends the ladder and makes off. They haven't gone far when she discovers her error, but the tramp drags her along by force. Meanwhile, poor Hank, reviving from the effects of the blow, rolls over and over until he reaches Stebbins' porch steps. Disarranging the gag he calls and brings to his aid Dad Stebbins and the rest of the household, who, after a hurried explanation from Hank, start after the human gorilla in whose clutches they realize poor Cynthia must be. After a spirited chase, serious in agonizing earnestness, and comical in ruralistic details, they come up with the miscreant, and the poor trembling Cynthia is handed over to her dad, who in turn hands her to the brave hero Hank, at which there is general rejoicing.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The rivalry on the part of the latter is friendly, although he is well aware that his position in life does not give him the opportunity of surrounding the girl with the good things of life. The young ship owner's rivalry is of the opposite nature, filled with venom, and he considers it an effrontery that a poor country lad should dare attempt to rival him in the affections of the lady of his choice. The girl is finally put to the test, and in a dramatic scene declares her love for the hero. The unsuccessful ship owner, much angered by his defeat, swears vengeance. Finding the girl alone, the ship owner again attempts to force himself into her favor, but is repulsed. Her infuriated admirer grasps the girl, forcing a kiss upon her lips just as her accepted lover appears upon the scene. The boy, in his anger, knocks the man down, and after a struggle, forces him to apologize. The humiliation hurts him more than the blow, and in his bitterness and anger the ship owner secures the services of some of his seamen attached to a sailing vessel about to leave port and track our young hero as he is leaving a rendezvous with his sweetheart. They attack the youth in a lonely spot, and after a severe struggle, render him insensible and take him aboard the vessel. The lad is forced by the captain to sign articles as an apprentice, then beaten and abused, is made to swab the decks. Biding his time, he strikes the officer in charge, knocking him down. Then plunges overboard and after swimming until he is thoroughly exhausted, reaches the rocks of the shore. (The scenery at this particular point where our hero climbs the rocks with the surf and wild waves dashing about him cannot he excelled.) After eluding the pursuing crew our hero starts back to his lady love's cottage. In the meantime the ship owner has taken into his service a renegade Mexican, and with his aid, after knocking down her old colored servant, kidnaps the now unprotected girl, taking her to an abandoned mission, where he forces an old priest residing there to promise to marry them, regardless of the girl's consent. The youth at last reaches the mainland after a perilous climb over almost inaccessible rocks, and learns from his sweetheart's servitor the story of the outrage. Scarcely able to walk, owing to his former exertions, he secures a horse from a friendly traveler and goes in hot pursuit, reaching the rendezvous just as the final words are about to be spoken. Realizing his helplessness, in his already weakened condition, he grasps a revolver from the Mexican's holster and puts both the ship owner and his accomplice to flight. With his sweetheart in his arms he persuades the priest to repeat the ceremony, and the final words that his unexpected appearance prevented are then spoken that make them man and wife.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Gilbert M.

Bidding his sweetheart Mary a fond, but tearful farewell, he then takes his leave of his dear old parents, his mother presenting him with a miniature of herself, as a memento to guide him along the path of righteousness. He is not long in the metropolis when his bright, alert manner appeals to the manager of a banking house and he obtains employment. He had resolved not to return home until he has made a name for himself, and five years later we find him holding a position of responsibility with good salary in the concern. His appearance has somewhat changed, owing to his growing a beard, and one day, taking his mother's picture from his pocket he decides to pay them a visit. The decision is coincident with a letter he receives later during the day. It is from his sweetheart Mary and tells him of his parents' dire straits, which they, through pride, have kept from him. But as they are on the eve of eviction she asks that he help them. Back he goes with his savings, ample to relieve their difficulties, and to surprise them enters the inn and engages a room incog. He has displayed his well-filled wallet in their presence, and their extreme desperation makes them covetous. When the boy lies down for a nap the old father cannot resist, and in securing the wallet arouses the boy, and is forced to knock him on the head. Thinking he had killed his guest, he takes his inert body out and deposits him in the field under the bushes, where he is found later by Mary, who, calling help, assists him to her home nearby, he recovering from the blow on the way. Meanwhile the old couple have gone back to the inn and upon opening the wallet what a revelation: \"My God, we have murdered our own boy.\" They find therein the mother's picture. They are paralyzed with fear and sorrow, so in an almost maniacal condition they go to Mary's home to confess their awful deed. You may imagine their feelings when they are brought face to face with their boy, and dropping on their knees in humble contrition they thank God for the deliverance.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

With this object to the fore the Suicide Club of America holds its monthly meeting to select the next candidate for mortuary honors. Lots are drawn and Frank Fairmount picks the fatal card \"23.\" The President then presents Frank with the necessary skidoo instruments, a pistol, a dagger, a bottle of poison and a rope, and wishes him success. Frank arrives home at the same time as a letter addressed to him which informs him that he has fallen heir to $50,000. Now to commit suicide under these conditions is out of the question. The members are very much upset by not seeing notice of Frank's demise in the newspaper, so they go in a body to ascertain the cause. Frank meets them with a paper to sign releasing him from his oath, but they indignantly refuse until he closes the door and turns on the gas. Now while they would speed the parting guest, they are loath to go with him, so they sign.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Jack Dunn rudely jostles against Mary, which arouses the ire of Tim, who lays Jack out with a powerful blow, for Tim is somewhat of a pugilist. The confusion brings the boss, a bantam, on the scene, who scolds, yes, actually scolds Tim, and Tim picks the boss up bodily, spanks him and quits. For some time he wanders about looking for work, but without success, until he is finally evicted from his boarding house. Discouraged and hungry he passes a restaurant. The sight of the viands in the window emphasizes his already famished condition, so he enters and begs for a bite to eat. The proprietor coldly waves him away with a refusal, and in abject desperation he seizes a piece of pie and runs, overturning everybody who attempts to hinder him. Out of the place he rushes followed by a mob. A policeman joins the pursuers and Tim finding them gaining on him rushes into a vacant house and ascends the stairs. In dashes the copper with such force that he stumbles and drops his gun. Tim seizes this and compels the guardian of the peace to divest himself of his cap and coat, which he puts on. Locking the policeman in the room, he rushes past the mob at the door, who think him the cop. He makes them believe the thief has escaped by the window and sends them one way while he goes the other. Free, he hides in one of the side streets to get his breath. While there an Italian woman rushes up and calls for help, as her husband is at home drunk and threatening to kill them all. Here is trouble. He tries to back out, but the woman insists he being a cop it is his duty to protect her. He goes and with one punch lays the wild Italian out stiff. He then drags him to the station house and receives the praise of the chief for bagging a dangerous and much sought for criminal.

Such was the case with Bob Spaulding, a manly fellow, who meets Dr. Rankin and his wife on the street while they are engaged in a violent tiff. The doctor is about to strike his wife when Bob interferes, incurring the resentment of the doctor. During the flurry Mrs. Rankin drops her card case. From a card inside he learns the address and goes there to return it. They meet, and it is a case of love at first sight; but she is a wife, and beyond his reach. Disconsolate, he leaves, and stops in a neighboring café, where he sits and drinks a glass of beer, his thoughts ever on the sad, sweet face of the abused wife. While thus engaged, a couple of thugs drop knockout in his glass, and when he is well under the influence of the soporific they secure his valuables, and one then gets the card. At their den, after dividing the spoils, the one determines to go to the address on the card, where he is caught in the act by the doctor, whom he shoots in a struggle. Meanwhile, Bob has been thrown out of the café as a drunk, and wanders aimlessly about until he reaches the home of the doctor just as the thug leaves. He seems drawn thither by an irresistible power. Entering by the door left open by the crook, he stumbles and falls over the prostrate form of the doctor, where he lies with the crook's pistol beside him until aroused by the wife, who enters the room. As he slowly regains his reason, the awful imagination of his being a murderer forces itself upon him. There he stands over the lifeless form with pistol in hand, unable to give any account of his actions. The wife, however, doesn't believe him guilty, and allows him to escape. Leaving the city, he obtains employment in another town as machinist in a factory, but still haunted by the false spectre, for he is self-accused of a crime he did not commit. One day, while glancing over the paper, his eye strikes an article headed: \"The Mystery Solved,\" which goes on to state that the real murderer was found dying in a hovel by a Salvation Army girl, and with his last breath confesses to killing of Dr. Rankin. Wild with joy, Bob hastens back to claim the widow, who is now free to listen to his pleadings, which are not in vain.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Ferrari's pretty daughter, Giannina, was beloved by one of his apprentices, Sandro. Filippo, a crippled youth and the best violin maker in Cremona, also loved the girl with a pure, holy affection that is more spiritual than material, but realizing his unattractiveness through his deformity, suffers his hopelessness with resignation. Yearly there is a prize of a precious chain of gold awarded to the maker of the best violin, and all the apprentices strive to win it. On this occasion, however, the hand of Giannina is to be bestowed upon the most proficient craftsman, and this induces the young men to make extra efforts to win. Sandro fully appreciates the rare talent of Filippo and feels sure his wonderful skill will win his sweetheart from him. Crushed and despairing he seeks out Giannina and tells her his fears, she tearfully acknowledging the strength of his reasoning. While thus occupied they are overheard by Filippo, who sees what woe his success would mean for her, and thinking only of her happiness, through his great love for her he makes a great sacrifice. Going to his room he takes his instrument and goes and places it in Sandro's box, taking Sandro's violin and putting it in his own. Sandro, however, thwarts the good intention of Filippo by exchanging the instruments, not knowing what Filippo had done, thereby upsetting the planned munificence of the cripple. When the instruments are placed in competition, and the prizes are about to be awarded, Sandro's conscience pricks him, and calling the cripple aside, confesses his deed. Filippo bursts into taunting laughter, telling him what he, himself, had done, and now he spoiled it all. Judgment is passed and Filippo is, of course, the victor. The chain is placed about his neck, and the hand of Giannina placed in his. But also, he feels she recoils, and thinking only of her happiness he crashes his violin over his knee, thereby putting himself out of the contest and making Sandro the winner. He then places the chain about Sandro's neck, and handing the girl over to him he rushes from the hall. We finally leave him alone in his room, crushed and dejected, yet contented in the thought that he had made her happy.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Herr Von Schmitt, a young musician, comes to this country from Germany, and ekes a living teaching violin. At home he has become imbued with the doctrines of Karl Marx, the promoter of the communistic principles of socialism, the alleged Utopian scheme of universal co-operation, which in time, and under the control of intemperate minds becomes absolute anarchy. Von Schmitt, however, succeeding in a moderate degree to procure comfort by his art, is gradually being weaned from his former covetous spirit, and turns a deaf ear to the persuasive arguments of his former companions. Among his pupils is Miss Helen Walker, the daughter of a wealthy capitalist. A strong friendship springs up between teacher and pupil, which ripens into love before they are aware of it. Von Schmitt, unable to restrain himself any longer, during a lesson at his studio declares his love, and is, of course, owing to the disparity of rank, spurned. Enraged by the seemingly unreasonable condition of affairs, he hearkens to the argument of his anarchistic friends, and becomes one of their body. At a meeting there takes place a drawing of lots to select the assassins of a certain monopolist, whose name is unknown to him. By a fateful fortuity he is selected as one of the two to do the job. Armed with a bomb, they proceed to the home, a mansion in the swell section of the city, and while one goes into the cellar to place the infernal machine. Von Schmitt stays outside to watch. While there the melody of his own violin composition floats out on the night air, and ascending the stoop he peers through the window and beholds Helen playing the violin. The realization of what is about to happen for the moment rivets him to the spot. This is her home; he had never known it as she always came to his studio for her lessons. To save her he must act quickly. Diving into the cellar he finds his companion has adjusted the bomb and already lighted the fuse. He begs him to desist, but to no purpose. To his entreaty the other replies, \"Remember your oath.\" \"To perdition with such oaths, from whence they emanate!\" and seizing him an awful struggle ensues. The other man succeeds in overpowering him, and binding him hands and feet leaves him to be destroyed with the rest. With supernatural effort he crawls toward the bomb and with his teeth bites the fuse in two as the fire is within a few inches of the bomb. Calling for help he arouses the household who release him from his position. Well yon may guess what the finish will be. Well it did, and they lived happy ever afterwards.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The pocketbook falls to the ground and the parties pass on, ignorant of the occurrence. A moment later a chap passes the spot and grabbing up the wallet hurries from the scene taking a byway into another neighborhood. Reaching a lonely section of the street, he examines the find, takes the money and throws the wallet away. Now by a cruel trick of fate Wallace passes this way, picks up the purse and is examining it when the owner who has discovered his loss and remembers now of being bumped into by Wallace, comes up, and the evidence certainly looks verifying, so Wallace is arrested. The case is brought to trial before a jury and by a singular fortuity the finder of the money is impaled on the jury. This would seem another subtle trick of derisive fate, for the man himself is not cognizant of the nature of the case upon which he is to sit. You may imagine his amazement when he hears the testimony and is banded with the others the incriminating wallet. To anyone with the most meager powers of discernment the ease looks clearly a case of theft against Wallace. What could be more convincing, his brushing against the plaintiff while in the act of returning the money to his pocket, and then being found with the wallet in his hand: worse still is the fact of his being an ex-convict. The retiring of the jury to their room seemed but as a matter of form, so you may imagine their surprise when the ballot results in eleven to convict and one to acquit. It is easy to guess who cast the one dissenting vote, the real offender. Arguments, entreaties, threats are all in vain; he stubbornly refuses to change his opinion. Well, they at length decide to give up the hope of agreeing, and are about to return to court, when the man calls them back, and under their promise of secrecy restores the money to the purse. They then file into court and to the surprise of all render a verdict of \"not guilty.\" The wallet, with its contents, is secretly returned to the owner.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The trio then repair to the Empire Theater, where the Burlesque Company is playing, of which La Tunita, the Queen of the Orient, is the bright peculiar star.

One of the young dance hall girls hears the phony preacher and is greatly moved by his message. The girl leaves the dance hall and goes to her room, where, weeping, she kneels and prays. Her life is changed, and she now becomes a dedicated settlement house worker. One day the girl encounters the young man. He, of course, is not now in disguise; and he is falling down drunk. At first the girl is disillusioned, but then she realizes that, although his words were falsely delivered, their message was nonetheless her salvation. The young man slinks away, but now he, too, sees the light. Soon he goes out to look for the girl, and he finds her assisting an old man who has fallen on the road. Their eyes meet and we can tell that this is a new beginning for the two converts.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The two soon find the boss's wallet on the floor, and the son rushes off to catch up with his father. While he's gone, a poor vendor seizes the opportunity to turn robber. He grabs the secretary's purse and locks her in the airtight vault. The son returns, and soon he becomes aware of his beloved's plight. He doesn't know and cannot find the combination to the vault, so off he goes again to catch dear old dad. He just misses dad's train and sends a telegram ahead to have his father return immediately. But dad wasn't on the train. He had forgotten important papers that he needed for the trip. Now he's back at the office, blissfully unaware that his secretary is dying just a few feet away. Then off he goes again. The son returns and is told (by a man who was unaware of the secretary's plight) that he has just missed his father. Away the son rushes again. This time he catches up with dad.

There were some nice large glasses of beer to be obtained for five cents, but this she spurned, for the menu of that day was very alluring. It was aristocratic food, not plebeian drink she desired, and so she starts to order. Surprised groans from Hank. But the worst is yet to come. Several friends of Miss Bird appear. \"Why, boys! You're just in time to join us.\" Hank (sotto voce), \"And I only have a dollar.\" The meal is over; the boys have departed regaled and poor Hank is longer and leaner than ever, but the bill presented him, while long, is by no means lean. \"And I only have a dollar.\" The dollar the waiter takes as a tip, and Hank's watch and pin are left behind to liquidate the bill. Not only that. On leaving the cafe. Miss Bird meets a gentleman friend and shakes Hank unceremoniously. As Hank views their forms fading in the distance, he murmurs, \"I shall hie me to the lemon grove where I belong.\" He does.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The influence of the warm constant sun, without excessive amenity was conducive to lethargy and lethargy is the seed of romance. The dreamer is a romancer. This Biograph story starts some time before Mexican independence was proclaimed in California, which occurred in 1822. Perdita Arguello, the pretty Spanish senorita is beloved by Jose Manuella, a wealthy young Spaniard, who migrated to the new world in search of adventure. A man of qualities, he surrenders claim upon the girl when he finds her heart is given to Pedro Cortes, a handsome troubadour of the village. Cortes is just the sort of fellow to impress a thoughtless and unsophisticated girl with his gentle persuasive manner together with his talent as a musician. Of poetic temperament, she yields to his plan and marries him. But what a calamity! Twenty years later we see the result of her folly. Cortes proved to be a worthless dipsomaniac and reprobate. Spending his time and money she earns at the tavern. The most unfortunate feature is that they have a son, now nearly 19 years old. Perdita realizes that the environs and example of the father are not favorable to the boy's well-being, hence she resolves to save him. It is at a time when Baja and Alta California are in conflict, and Manuella, Perdita's former lover, is now Governor. So she appeals to him to provide a future for their son. The Governor takes the boy into his own company. But is there any wonder that the son of such a dog as Cortes should prove himself to be a despicable whelp? He is not long in the service when the blood of his father asserts itself. Drunkenness is one of the first offenses. Next theft of the meanest order, that of robbing his sleeping comrades-in-arms. Perdita has dispatched a letter of thanks to the Governor, which he is reading as the drunken boy is brought before him. The tone of the letter induces Manuella to be easy on the boy that she might live in ignorance of his real nature. However, later she writes that she is dying and believing her son has made a name for himself, she asks to be allowed to see him before she dies. As the Governor reads this letter the boy is brought before him, having been caught for thieving. Manuella is thoroughly disgusted with the boy, but in order to have his mother die happy, he decorates him, making him appear before her as a hero. When she breathes her last the medals are torn his breast and he is sent to prison where the punishment he justly deserves is inflicted. In this subject are shown a series of most beautiful scenes of Southern California, which are photographically perfect.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama, History","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The husband, one of the miners in the camp, dies, and the rough men gather to tell her of her loss. She does not survive the news long, and the little child is left alone. How the miners take up a collection for the \"kid\" contributing personal ornaments, revolvers, knives and even a whisky bottle, is laughable. Finally, the child, in playing near the camp, discovers gold, and this leads to its formal adoption by the camp.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Edwin S.

Dick even goes so far as to join the Anti-marriage Club. But the sub-title of this film is \"A Comedy Of Errors Corrected By Cupid\"; and now that mischievous lad goes to work. Dick and Dora (strangers, mind you) are traveling on the same train; and by accident(?) they sit together. Now Dick, on his way to the train station, had gotten some grains of rice stuck to his clothing by accident(?). Also, by accident(?) a member or Dick's Anti-Marriage Club is riding on the same train. He sees the \"couple\", sees the rice, and puts one and one together to get two married people. He wires ahead to the Club members that Dick is a traitor. When the train arrives the Club members have arranged a mock reception party for Dick and Dora. But many of the good citizens of the town take the thing seriously, and soon Dora has a pile of wedding gifts. Well, a couple of well placed darts later, Dick and Dora decide not to return those gifts; and, to quote the Biograph Bulletin, \"Cupid lands a knockout.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

'Broncho Billy' Anderson","Plot":"Matt Malone, a highwayman and night rider who has long baffled the police authorities, loves Nona McMahon, posing with her as a cowboy from up country. The McMahons are in trouble and old McMahon has been forced to mortgage the homestead. The money lender has been lenient up to this time, but, struck by the beauty of Nona McMahon, he endeavors to win her love. But she declines his offer. The lender, named McDermott, threatens foreclosure. In the meantime, Malone has been idle. It is his desire to make one grand coup and quit the game for good. He hears that the mountain stage coach is soon to carry a large amount of gold, and he decides to make a try for the loot. The hold-up occurs, but it's not as profitable as he expected. Also, he fears his identity has been discovered. He returns to his dugout, resolved to see his sweetheart and then quit the country. On his way to the girl's home he sees a notice posted by the sheriff, offering a reward of $5,000 for Malone's capture. He shoots down the sign and rides off to McMahon's. The girl greets him pleasantly. Their conversation drifts to McMahon's financial troubles, and the girl shows Malone a note from McDermott, stating that $5,000 must be paid the day after or they must vacate. Malone decides to tell the girl everything, and insists that she turn him over to the sheriff and gain the reward. He thrusts a revolver in her hands just as the sheriff enters. The manacles are slipped on and Malone and the sheriff go into the jail as the girl drops sobbing on the doorstep.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Gilbert M.

The two young fellows are rivals for the hand of a pretty girl of the village, and after her marriage with the one of her choice, the other swears to be revenged. To effect this he pours chemically treated oil into the irrigation ditches of the husband's farm. This of course ruins the land for vegetation, but it brings the husband a fabulous hum from a speculator in oil lands, who thinks he has struck a highly productive oil field.

The wife becomes deranged and wanders the roads with her little girl until, finally, she even becomes separated from the child. The girl is adopted by a well-to-do farmer and his wife, who raise her as their own. One day when the girl has grown into a lovely young woman, she meets a prosperous and handsome older man through a strange twist of fate. They fall in love and are engaged to be married. On the very day of the wedding the poor mother wanders to the farmer's house. She sees a picture of her daughter as a three year old and recognizes her. Learning that the girl is to be married that day, the mother rushes to the church. When she arrives there she and the groom recognize one another, and immediately they both realize that Ben has nearly married his own daughter.

At first it seems possible, but later there comes such an insatiable craving he can stand it no longer, so he rents a quiet place where he goes and smokes in peace. All goes well, until his better half notices the regularity of his little walks, ostensibly for exercise, and she grows suspicious of she knows not what.

He is refused employment at \"Double Circle Ranch.\" As he is leaving the place, he meets the ranchman's daughter and they are mutually impressed with each other. The owner of the ranch receives a letter saying that cattle-rustlers are operating in the vicinity. On his way home Jack accidentally walks into the camp of the cattle thieves. After questioning him, he is given employment, which he accepts, much against his will. Intent on his work, he does not see the ranchman's daughter approaching from behind. She covers him with her revolver, but Jack tells her his troubles. Still suspicious, the girl proceeds to the hut occupied by he and his mother, and finding things corresponding with Jack's words, she gives money to his mother. Relieved of immediate worries, Jack goes back to his mining ventures and strikes it rich. One day as Jack was visiting the ranchman's daughter, a creditor called upon the now ruined owner with a bill, which he was unable to meet. Jack, however, returned the favor of the girl, by closing the account.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"04 Dec 1911","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Angel of Paradise Ranch","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Warren Kerrigan, Pauline Bush, Jack Richardson","Plot":"Bill Fremont is in love with Edna Curtis, the daughter of a neighboring ranchman. Edna's brother, Fred, does not like Fremont, and objects to him paying attention to his sister. As the ranchmen in the vicinity are missing cattle, it looks very much as if there were an active rustler around. Fremont (who is the rustler), sees a chance to divert the suspicion from himself upon young Curtis, and informs his employer that he has good reasons for believing Curtis is the rustler. Fremont's employer, while in town, secures the services of a cowboy by the name of Curly Hitchcock (who is a crack shot), to run down the cattle thief. Curly, while on the range, accidentally discharges his gun, receiving a flesh wound, and rushes to the nearest house of Edna Curtis, and her willingness to aid him excites his admiration. A short while after, Curly returns to the ranchman who has employed him, and taking a powerful telescope, rides out on the range. There, he meets Edna. Fremont comes upon them, and when Curly rides away, Fremont tells Edna that her bother is a rustler, and that Curly has been employed to capture him. Frightened, she hurries to her home to tell her folks and to hide her brother. A few hours after Curly left Edna and Fremont, he notices, through his powerful telescope, Fremont driving off a herd of cattle. The ranchmen are now infuriated, as they have discovered that more cattle have been stolen, and believe that the gun-man is a fake. Curly arrives at the Curtis home, just in time to get a shot at Fremont, who has led a number of ranchmen to Curtis' home to hang Fred. Everything ends happily, and Fremont gets his just deserts.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"18 Sep 1911","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Gun Man","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

They live in a squalid home, made more wretched by his inability to provide sufficient food. He goes out in search of work, but is unsuccessful. Finally, in desperation, he steals a loaf of bread regardless of consequences. He hastens home with it, pursued by a crowd, and gives it to his mother. Valjean is arrested for the theft and sentenced to five years at hard labor. He with other convicts, is put in a stone quarry, and there makes his first acquaintance with Javert, a prison guard, who appears prominently throughout the story. The first notice Javert takes of Valjean is on account of his great strength in lifting a stone that no other prisoner can lift. In the prison dormitory word is whispered about that there is a chance for one man to escape, and among themselves the prisoners decide that they will draw lots to determine the one who shall make the break for liberty. The lot falls to Valjean, and with the aid of a small saw, he is soon in the open. The alarm is given and pursuit is begun, but Valjean eludes his pursuers. Javert is greatly vexed at the escape, for he is an automatic creature in doing his duty. He performs his duty like a machine, and his duty comes before everything else with him. Like a hunted animal, Valjean reaches the town of Digne, in southern France. He begs from door to door, but meets with many rebuffs, until one kind hearted woman directs him to the house of the parish priest, Myriel. The good priest takes him in, feeds him, and provides him with a cot for the night. In the night Valjean yields to temptation. He steals a pair of silver spoons, and departs. On the road he meets two \"gendarmes\" who take him back to the town, and before the priest. To his surprise Valjean is given a pair of silver candlesticks by the priest who dismisses the police, pretending that Valjean is an old acquaintance. Myriel then gives Valjean a letter to his brother, a manufacturer of glass beads in Montreuil. The action of the priest touches Valjean's heart and he repents bitterly of his wrongful act. He goes to Montreuil and is given a position by the priest's brother and is thenceforth known as \"Mr. Madeleine.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Albert Capellani","Released":"01 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"60 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Les Misérables, Part 1: Jean Valjean","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Paul Capellani (adaptation), Victor Hugo (novel)","Production":"N/A","Language":"French","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Opening the orange again, he shows that all the pulp has gone, a duster having taken its place. A number of tricks with colored balls follow and a very effective section shows milk poured into a bowl from one glass and then claret added from another. Then comes the surprise, the claret suddenly leaves the milk with which it had been mingled and the milk follows, each liquid going back into the glass in which it was at first.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Walter R.

Her daughter, recently returned from an Eastern boarding school, could not assist her and, although the cowboys in her employ were faithful, the ranch needed an executive head. John Morgan, a neighboring ranchman, had long cast envious eyes upon the widow's increasing herd of cattle, and desired to marry the daughter in order to obtain possession of her ranch. He offers to manage her affairs for her, but the widow distrusts him and refuses his offer. Mrs. Kendall finally secures the services of Jim Stevenson, a manly young cowboy, and he is introduced to the boys as the new manager. They take him out on the range that he may become better acquainted with his new duties. They encounter John Morgan, who is ordered off the range by the new manager. Morgan determines to force his attention on Hazel Kendall and hurries to the ranch house. He finds Hazel alone and attempts to kiss her when Jim, coming to the house to report, witnesses the struggle and rescues her from the distasteful caress.

Warren Kerrigan, Pauline Bush, Jack Richardson","Plot":"The Sheriff of Kickup Gulch had long been enamored of the beautiful daughter of the hotel keeper and his suit was progressing favorably when an eastern drummer appeared in the Gulch and started paying marked attentions to the hotel-keeper's daughter. She was very favorably impressed and, finding it difficult to choose between the two after their simultaneous proposal, decided to give them a test of bravery in order to win her hand. The test consisted of thrusting an arm in a rattlesnake's hole and the drummer became panic stricken, for he knew that it meant almost certain death to obey the request. The Sheriff, however, knowing that rattlesnakes always avoid tobacco, sprinkled the hole with tobacco from his pouch and thrust in his arm with impunity. Of course the lady chose the sheriff and left the crestfallen drummer to think it over. Left to his own devices he discovers the trick played by the wily sheriff, and determines to even up the score. He effects an entrance to the general store and substitutes iron filings for the stock of giant powder. The next day he appears at the store and makes a purchase of several pounds of his substituted giant powder. Returning to the hotel he creates a panic by spreading his powder on a paper and sitting beside it with a lighted cigar in his mouth. The frightened spectators send for the sheriff to subdue the mad man, and he now appears with his fiancé, gun in hand, to arrest the drummer. The drummer calmly lights a match and orders, \"Drop that gun or I'll drop this match,\" which he holds at close proximity to his fake powder. The sheriff is panic stricken and turns in ignominious flight, leaving his fiancé to her fate. The fate in store for her however, is a complete revulsion of feeling and she decides that eastern wit is better than cheap heroics.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"29 May 1911","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Rattlesnakes and Gunpowder","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Stella discovers the gun and takes it away from him. Stella goes to the jewelers and steals a necklace. The jeweler sees it in a mirror but doesn't stop her. Instead he follows her. She meets with the earl and gives him the necklace and tells him to sell it. After they part, the jeweler grabs her and confronts her with her misdeed. He doesn't hand her over to the police, though he gets an opportunity. Instead he compels her to have dinner with him. The earl sells the necklace to a wholesale jeweller. The jeweller buys back the necklace and gets a testimonial from the wholesale jeweller about the events. Stella leaves the earl for her dinner appointment but forgets her handbag in which the earl finds the gun and a note leading him to the jewellers house. The earl shoots Stella.

The ranch man offers his cowboys one thousand dollars each if they will help him. He suggests that they go to town and kidnap a handsome man and also abduct his daughter. Accordingly, some of the boys are detailed to abduct the daughter, others to kidnap the handsome storekeeper, and the ranch man himself goes after a justice of the peace. The daughter is secured with little difficulty, but Arthur White puts up a strenuous fight before he is tied up. Leaving their captives bound and blindfolded, the cowboys repair to the opposite side of the barn for a friendly game of cards. Arthur succeeds in freeing himself and is very much surprised to find his fellow victim is the girl that has captivated his fancy. They mount a horse and ride away. The cowboys discover that their captives have escaped and start in pursuit.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Romance, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"07 Sep 1911","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Three Million Dollars","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Consequently he is highly elated when John Darrow, foreman of the 'X Bar' outfit, offers him a job punching cows. He is fitted out at the ranch in chaps, spurs, sombrero, etc., and feels that he is a regular cowboy. On his first appearance in his new outfit the boys work their game of gun music on him and, in this instance, are treated to a genuine Yiddisher dance. Ikey is very angry, but bides his time until he can even up the score. He learns the work on the ranch and one day succeeds in roping a cow, thinking he has roped a steer. Payday the boys follow their time-honored custom and go to town to celebrate. Ikey, however, with true business instinct, remains at the ranch and, during the cowboy's absence, gets out his old peddling pack and sets up a pawn shop in a corner of the ranch yard. The boys return from town broke and when Ikey shows them his pawn shop they decide to 'hock' their guns. Ikey gets possession of every gun on the ranch and then starts to do a little shooting himself. The boys scatter at his approach and the Yiddisher cowboy is monarch of all he surveys.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"19 Jun 1911","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Yiddisher Cowboy","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}
