All sorts of wonderful things happen. A cannon takes the place occupied by the table, and belches forth flame and smoke. A large cage appears mysteriously in the center of the room, through the bars of which the Devil passes as if it were an open door. By his magic, he makes the cavalier pass through the bars in the same wonderful fashion.

Suddenly, in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears and surprises the astronomer. At the command of the Fairy Queen, who suddenly appears, Satan vanishes; she awakens the astronomer and as he goes forward to meet her she disappears. The astronomer is very much excited, and, rushing over to the large telescope he tries to discover by what means she had vanished. The moon now appears, and begins her repast by eating the immense telescope used by the astronomer. The astronomer flies around apparently wild at the loss of his wonderful telescope. Suddenly the moon opens wide her mouth and there comes forth a tot of about five summers. She is immediately followed by two others, and they proceed to dance around the astronomer, and vanish one at a time until but one is left. The astronomer, picking her up, thinking he could keep her, hugs her tightly in his arms, but she also vanishes. Tired and heart-broken the astronomer grasps a broom and attempts to strike the moon, when she suddenly vanishes and in the distance laughs at him, rolling his eyes forward and backward, apparently convulsed with laughter. The moon suddenly changes to a crescent, and a fairy appears sitting on it. The veiled figure which stands before him throws back its veil and becomes animated; he rushes forward and grasps it, when, to his utter amazement, it disappears in the air. The Fairy Queen appears in the crescent. She first seats herself, and the astronomer puts his arms out for her, thinking perhaps he can reach her, when she disappears and in her place there stands a marble statue of a man. The astronomer, in his efforts to reach her falls to the ground. Rising and seeing the statue he is so incensed that he grabs a club, and as he is about to crush the statue it suddenly becomes alive. The large moon again appearing to his view he throws himself into it, and the moon, winking one eye, proceeds to chew him up. The moon's large teeth are seen to sink into the astronomer again and again until he is reduced to small pieces, when piece by piece he is ejected from the moon's mouth and lies there, one piled on the other. Suddenly in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears, but the Fairy Queen drives him off again. She proceeds to pick up different parts of the astronomer and hurls them across the room, and piece by piece they take their proper position in the chair, until the astronomer is again seated as he was before.

The country yokel is shown to his room and divests himself of his best Sunday-go-to-meetin' clothes. His little bunch of whiskers that adorn his chin seem to be as proud of him as his Melindy Jane, whom he left in Grassville, back over yonder. He is finally undressed and tumbles into bed, resolving meanwhile to dream of the good prices he will realize in his produce. While pondering over matters, he looks around and discovers a Ghost standing in the middle of the room. Silas becomes scared, begosh, and leaping out on the floor begs the Ghost to do him no harm. The Ghost suddenly vanishes and the Hayseed is about to jump into bed again when Satan appears from under the sheets and scares him to such an extent that he is willing to promise him even a box of fresh rooster eggs if he will only go away. But his Satanic Majesty says 'nit,' and he is almost frantic. After causing much excitement our poor unfortunate Silas is hustled out in the street, but we are not informed whether he gets his money back or not. This film will cause tears to flow with laughter.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"01 Aug 1899","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Haunted House","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Entire parade shows elephants, camels, band wagons, chariots, cages of animals, and full circus paraphernalia, making a most interesting subject. The next picture shows the assembly or grand entry, and includes the entrance into the arena of the elephants, chariots, wild animals, horses, camels, etc. We next show an exciting horse race, consisting of eight horses, on which are mounted an Indian, a squaw, a Filipino girl, an Arab woman, an Arab, a cowboy and an English jockey and an American jockey. The picture concludes with a bareback team race. In this race two horses are abreast, the driver standing up, with one foot resting on one horse and one upon the other. They make two circuits of the ring and furnish a very exciting climax to the picture. We conclude the Day at the Circus Series with a fifty-foot picture, showing a very exciting chariot race. Two chariots appear in the race, one drawn by four white horses and the other by four bay horses.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Documentary, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Edwin S.

Just as he draws back from the uncanny object, the doors of a mediaeval wardrobe fly back and a hand prods him with a sword. He turns to confront his assailant when it vanishes, and at the same instant the skull flies to the other end of the room. He clutches at the skull, when it turns into the half form of a girl from the waist up, suspended in mid-air. As he gazes in amusement, the other half of the girl, fully dressed from her waist down, walks across the room, and the two halves of the figure join, making a girl complete. In an amorous fashion the old man folds his arms around the girl's waist with the intention of stealing a kiss, but the girl immediately changes into an old woman, who grins in evident delight at the old man's discomfort. In great anger he throws her into the wardrobe and locks the door. Unseen by him, the woman has again become a girl. A great effect is here produced. Through the doors, which are solid and closed, the form of the girl appears through the woodwork. Hastily opening the door, the old man is then confronted by an Egyptian mummy. Other strange things happen. As the pawnbroker flies from the room a large and grotesque head arises from the smoke and slowly advances toward the spectators. Larger and larger the head grows until it fills the entire picture, and appears as though it would swallow the whole audience. A most laughable and mystifying scene.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.5","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Walter R.

From this most simple tale we have produced a play that is both pleasing and amusing to young and old, introducing as we do many surprising tricks and dissolving effects. We have followed as near as possible the tale of Perrault, which is well known to all, and which has been translated into all languages. We have, on account of the peculiar effects that must be introduced in animated pictures, arranged it also with humorous features, without which it would not have been so highly interesting and pleasing as a motion picture demonstration of the fairy tale. The story itself is doubtless familiar to many of our customers, and we will, therefore, not attempt to describe it in our catalogue matter, except to state that it is composed of the finest trick and dissolving effects ever introduced, and that the action is replete from start to finish with humorous, emotional and spectacular situations.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Georges Méliès","Released":"26 Oct 1901","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Little Red Riding Hood","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Charles Perrault (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The scene opens in the bedroom of a hotel. A traveler appears, evidently a \"little worse for wear.\" After stretching and yawning, he proceeds to disrobe. He throws off his coat and vest, but to his surprise and anguish, he suddenly finds himself clothed in a continental uniform. He throws this off in anger, but immediately a policeman's costume flies on him. This is in turn thrown aside in great rage and he finds himself clothed in a soldier's uniform. At last, thinking himself successful, he makes for the bed and finds a skeleton complacently resting on his pillow. The bed suddenly disappears, leaving him seated on the floor, and great quantities of bed clothes rain down from the ceiling. The picture ends leaving the audience simply convulsed in laughter.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Walter R.

To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Documentary, Short","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"Frederick S.

The miser comes into the hall and is greatly astonished to find his fortune missing. He opens the coffer and immediately the bags leap out. He gathers them up and puts them back into the coffer. When he opens it again he finds that they have been transformed into seven young girls, who rush out and chase after him, beating him unmercifully. They shut him up in the coffer from which his gold has vanished. The miser pushes open the lid of the coffer, and to his profound despair finds that both young girls and money have disappeared.

A juggler summons two chairs, which come to the stage jumping and twirling around. Across the back of these chairs the operator places a sheet of glass on which he lays a box about four inches high. He then takes a table cover, with his servant's help, rolls it up and from the centre emerges a lady, beautifully dressed. At the juggler's order she jumps in the box, in which she completely disappears. The operator, in taking the box, notices an incredulous smile among the audience; he then affirms that the lady is still inside, and to prove it he puts the box on his knees and the girl appears again in full figure. He makes her go in again, and opening the box he shows that the girl has vanished and that her dresses only remain at the bottom. Then he jumps into the box himself, and his servant afterward; the box rolls off the stage without any help.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Georges Méliès","Released":"13 Jun 1903","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"1 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Enchanted Box","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

It may be of interest to our patrons to know the fact that every horse in this parade, with one exception, was killed shortly afterwards in a disastrous railway wreck.

The musketeer puts the hoop through the paper, and instantly the hoop is all covered with paper like those used by performers in the circus. The pages hold up the hoop; the paper bursts, only to let out a hideous clown, who goes and sits in the corner to see what is going to happen. Then the musketeer breaks the hoop, takes out of his hat a lot of flowers, which he throws on the pieces of the hoop, and by his act he makes a lovely wreath, from which appears a beautiful woman. This woman is then substituted by an immense and grinning face, into which the clown jumps. Then an explosion is heard and nothing is left of the clown nor the head. The musketeer takes the pages on his soldiers, one after the other, and they are changed as his coat and hat. Finally he disappears in a most mysterious way.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Georges Méliès","Released":"13 Jun 1903","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"4 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"La guirlande merveilleuse","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

{"tomatoReviews":"N/A","tomatoRotten":"N/A","Type":"movie","imdbVotes":"N/A","Poster":"N/A","imdbID":"tt0000446","imdbRating":"N/A","Year":"1903","Rated":"N/A","Actors":"N/A","Plot":"This subject is a production upon which was spent a great deal of time and money. It was taken amid scenery of the wildest natural beauty and enacted with the greatest possible fidelity to the original. The costumes, arms, log cabins, etc., are all historically correct. The story embodies the adventures of the greatest of all the American scouts and pathfinders, \"Kit Carson,\" his life in the wilderness, his hand-to-hand conflicts with the savage Indians, his hairbreadth escapes and his safe return to his log cabin home in the clearing. The subject is absolutely a novelty in moving pictures. 1. MORNING IN THE WILDERNESS. As the dawn breaks, Kit Carson and his fellow trapper are seen awakening from their pine bough couches. They wash at the brook, start a fire and prepare their frugal meal. This finished, they remove all trace of the fire, arrange their packs, take their rifles and start off into the depths of the forest. 2. INDIANS FIND THE TRAIL. The same scene. The trappers have departed and a band of painted Indians appear. They discover the trail of the trappers, and after a brief conference start out after them. 3 IN CAMP FOR THE NIGHT. Here we seee Kit Carson and his companion, fatigued by the weary tramp of the day, locating their camp by the side of another stream. The evening meal is cooked and the trappers lie down to sleep. 4. THE NIGHT ATTACK. While Kit and his companion are asleep, the Indians make their treacherous attack. The fight is short and bloody. Three of the savages are laid low, but Kit's companion is killed and Kit himself after a terrific struggle, is taken captive and bound. 5. OVER THE LOG. Here we see the exultant savages and their captive threading their way through the dense growth of the forest. They come to a stream which is spanned by a large birch log. Over this the Indians pass in single file, followed by Kit, his arms bound but all senses alert. One buck brings up the rear. As Kit reaches the center of the log, he engages the attention of the buck for an instant, then quick as a flash topples him into the water, and springing into the water on the opposite side, Kit is lost to view. The other Indians come running back and plunge through the water in their eager search for Kit. 6. THE CANOE CHASE. A wild river. On either side immense pine trees. Around a distant turn Kit is seen coming in his canoe, paddling for dear life. He is followed by three other canoes, filled with Indians, all paddling desperately. Kit fires at the foremost canoe and all disappear around another bend of the river. 7. ARRIVAL OF THE INDIAN SCOUT. Farther down the river an Indian scout is seen rapidly approaching in his canoe. He runs his frail craft ashore and tells his companions of the coming of Kit. 8. ATTACK ON CANOE AND SECOND CAPTURE OF KIT. The Indians who have been warned in the preceding scene hide in ambush. Kit comes along in his canoe unconscious of this new danger. As he comes opposite the ambush, the savages, naked save for their breech-clothes, jump into the water, overturn the canoe, and after another thrilling conflict the intrepid Kit is again a prisoner. 9. IN THE INDIAN CAMP. This is a remarkable scene. Here we have the Indian village, with its skin-covered tepees. Squaws and their papooses, young bucks and Indian maidens are seen at their various occupations. Here we have real Indian life. Kit is brought into camp by his captors and his advent creates great excitement. He is tied to a tree and subjected to various tortures and indignities, which he bears with undaunted mein. Even when tomahawks are hurled at his head he does not falter. Night comes, and the life of the village is stilted. Kit is guarded by one brave, who sleeps on his rifle by the fire. Death seems very near, but help is near at hand. An Indian maiden, moved to compassion by his condition, severs his bonds and once again Kit is free. 10. THE HOME IN THE WILDERNESS. Here we see Kit's rude log cabin in the clearing. His wife and children are busy with household affairs and eagerly watching for the return of the father. A little girl runs in with the glad news, and soon Kit stalks in and is quickly overwhelmed by the loving embraces of his wife and children.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"01 Oct 1903","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"21 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Kit Carson","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Here we see in the midst of a primeval forest, a little clearing and the rude log-house erected by the sturdy frontiersman. A little girl leaves the cabin, and tripping daintily along the forest path in her bare feet, goes to a neighboring spring for water. What she sees lurking in the shadowy thickets causes her to fly back to the cabin for her life. She has no sooner passed the threshold, slamming the door behind her, when a half dozen painted Indians burst into view in close pursuit. Immediately the long rifle-barrel of the pioneer protrudes from a loophole in the cabin wall. It speaks, and a savage leaps into the air and falls clutching the sod. The other Indians slink back, only to reappear an instant later crawling through the grass like snakes and pushing bundles of dry limbs and grass before them. The settler's rifle speaks again and again, but the savages succeed in pushing the combustible material against the house, and in an instant it is fiercely blazing. AN INDIAN MASSACRE [BURNING OF THE CABIN AND MURDER OF THE SETTLERS]. A little girl runs in with the alarm. The door is quickly locked and barred and the long rifle appears at the loop-hole and is frequently fired. The Indians gradually close in on the ill-fated home, and finally have it ablaze from a fire of brushwood. The Indians, now in a frenzy over the success of their fiendish enterprise, procure a log and using it as a battering ram they hurl themselves upon the door and batter it in. The pioneer rushes out to defend his loved ones, but he is quickly overcome and tomahawked, and his wife as quickly meets the same fate. The little girl, terror-stricken by the awful scenes she has witnessed, is seized by the savages and carried off a prisoner. THE OATH! [DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES] In the next scene all that is left of the cabin is a smoldering ruin. A company of trappers come rapidly out of the forest and discover the bodies of the unfortunate man and woman. With bared heads, and in most impressive fashion they register an oath never to rest until they have wreaked vengeance on the Indian murderers and rescued the child. THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL [CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN]. A magnificent scene showing the savages leading their captive along a winding path on the mountain-side. The little girl sagaciously leaves a trail by tearing a bit from her dress. The trappers following shortly after discover the clue and press on in pursuit, encouraged by the knowledge that the girl is probably still living. VENGEANCE [RESCUE OF THE CHILD FROM THE INDIANS]. The Indians come to their evening camp by the side of a forest stream. After a drink of clear water, they tie the little girl to a tree and prepare for their night's rest. The trappers are close upon them however, and with a wild yell the white men hurl themselves upon the Indians. A terrific hand-to-hand combat ensues, and the Indians are slain remorselessly. The little girl is quickly released from her bonds and, as the picture ends, she is in the arms of one of the brave trappers who have rescued her. All of the scenes in this great production were made amidst the wildest and most beautiful scenery of the Adirondack Mountains, and the subject is one which will appeal strongly to all classes of people.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Western, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"01 Oct 1903","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"15 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Pioneers","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to stop the approaching train. They make him write an order to the engineer to take water at this station instead of at the regular watering stop. The train stops, the conductor comes to the office window, where the operator delivers the order while the bandits keep their revolvers trained on him. No sooner has the conductor left when they bind and gag the operator, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. This scene shows the train at the water tank. The bandits are hiding behind the tank, and just before the train pulls out they quickly board the express car wherein the messenger is busily engaged with his duties. Alarmed by the unusual sound, the messenger unlocks the door, peeps through the keyhole, discovers the bandits and quickly locks the iron boxes which contain the valuables. He then throws the key through small window and pulls out his revolver to defend the valuables entrusted to him. Two robbers succeed in entering the car. The messenger bravely attacks them and discharges his revolver, but he is quickly laid low by a bullet. The bandits bind and gag him and then try to open the treasure box. When they find it locked they search the messenger for the key, and as they do not find it, they blow up the strong box with dynamite. They take the valuables and the mail bags and quickly leave the car. During all this time the train is seen flying past beautiful scenery. While two of the robbers blow up the strong box in the express car, two other ones hold the engineer and the fireman at pistols' point. The fireman takes a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender to defend himself and his position, but he soon finds himself overpowered and thrown from the swiftly moving train. The two bandits then compel the engineer to stop the train. Forced by the robbers, the engineer brings the train to a stop, uncouples the engine and pulls ahead about two hundred feet, always covered by the bandits' pistols. In the meantime two of the bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches with hands up. They line them up along the tracks, go through their pockets and relieve them of all their valuables. One passenger makes an attempt to escape, but is instantly shot down by one of the bandits. As soon as they have all the booty the bandits mount the engine and make good their escape, while the passengers lend their helping hand to their unfortunate friend who is badly wounded by one of the bandits. The bandits bring all the booty on the locomotive and command the engineer to pull the lever and pretty soon we see them disappear in the distance. Far out in the rough countries the bandits command the engineer to stop, descend from the engine, and escape to the mountains with the stolen goods. This scene shows the bandits coming down from the mountains into the valley, where they cross a stream to get to a place of safety. The scenery is truly beautiful. One of the robbers, in his hurry, slips and falls in the water, but he quickly rises and makes good his escape. This scene brings us back to the interior of the telegraph office, where the operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After a desperate struggle he succeeds in reaching the table where his instruments stand. He telegraphs for help and manipulates the key with his mouth, and then falls to the floor, fainting from exhaustion. The operator's little daughter enters to bring him his daily dinner. She finds her father bound, kneels down, praying to the Lord to give her strength to help her poor father, throws a glass of water in his face, restoring him to consciousness, takes a knife and cuts the ropes and removes the gag from his mouth. This typical Western dance hall shows some men in company with women. A tenderfoot appears upon the scene and is made to dance in the regular Western style. Suddenly the door opens, the operator's little daughter enters and relates what has happened. The men quickly stop their merriment, take their guns and leave in pursuit of the outlaws. The bandits are seen dashing through the woods on spirited horses followed closely by the Sheriff and a large posse. One of the bandits is shot and falls from his horse, but he staggers to his feet again and kills one of the Deputy Sheriffs before he expires. This scene shows the bandits in a fierce fight with the Sheriff's posse. The bandits dismount their horses, and, not thinking that the Sheriff and his Deputy were so near, are just beginning to look over their booty when suddenly the Sheriff and his Deputies appear on the scene. A desperate battle takes place, and, after a brave stand the bandits and several of the pursuers breathe their last. This scene shows a life-size picture of Daniels, the chief of the bandits, as he takes aim and fires into the audience. The picture is so realistic that women scream, and even though no sound is heard, they put their fingers in their ears to shut out the noise of the firing.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Siegmund Lubin","Released":"26 Jun 1904","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Great Train Robbery","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

But the dusky belle is coy and declines to make the acquaintance of any of them, until one more fortunate than the rest is invited to a seat on the bench with her, and a most pronounced flirtation takes place between the lady and her beau. The course of true love seems to run smoothly, and we are next introduced to the lady's home, where the young man is paying a visit and is introduced by the girl to her, father and mother, typical old darkies of before the war time, and several funny scenes follow in which the kid hint her plays a prominent part. The coon favors his girl with many presents and lavishes attentions upon her, although it cannot he said that the courtship proceeds altogether without incident. A rival appears on the scene, razors are drawn and finally a duel is arranged, at which both suitors, accompanied by their seconds, appear on the field of honor and exchange shots at thirty paces; one of the combatants is carried off the field, while our original hero remains the master of the situation, and the girl, arriving at the moment, is so pleased with his valor that arrangements for the wedding are made at once. The happy climax is reached at last and the marriage ceremony makes the two coons one and ends the \"wooing\" in a wedding. Next is seen the home of the young couple, but quite a change has taken place. No longer does the colored gallant overwhelm his lady with presents and similar attentions. Put the familiar sign of \"Washing Done Here\" is apparent, and while the woman toils at the wash tub the married coon smokes, drinks and enjoys himself at his leisure until he decides to go out and enjoy the sights and pleasures of the town. In turn he visits a trap game and several other gambling scenes, not forgetting various saloons, at which he accumulates a very perceptible package. His gambling experience has been unsuccessful and he loses not only his money but his clothes as well, and finally is compelled to rob a scarecrow in order to get clothes enough to get home again at all, which he finally gains in a very disheveled and ragged condition. The unfortunate coon has not been home long before he is attacked by imaginary foes as the result of his drinking bout; seizing a broom he gives battle wildly but is surprised by his wife, who, disgusted with the condition in which her husband has returned, attacks him viciously and gives him the beating he so richly deserves and ends by throwing a tub of suds and dirty water all over him.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"16 Nov 1907","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Wooing and Wedding of a Coon","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Heralds now approach and Roman soldiers beat back the crowd to make way for the approach of the Roman Procurator. The scene changes to the home of Ben Hur, who is seen with his sister and mother on the house top. The cavalcade of Roman troops approaches, and to get a near view Ben Hur leans from the coping and knocks down one of the stones thereof onto the shoulder of the Procurator. This is seen and misconstrued by the Governor, who orders soldiers to arrest the inmates; they, after ineffectual pleas and struggles, are carried off. Ben Hur is consigned to the galleys, where he is loaded with chains. Here he signalizes himself by saving the life of Arrias, who publicly adopts him as his son and proclaims him a Roman citizen amidst the acclamations of the assembled crowd in the forum. Now comes the scene in the games where Ben Hur is challenged by Messala, and accepts it, to the great delight of the citizens. The chariots and athletes parade before the dais and in due time are arranged, and the chariot race commences. Three times 'round the ring dash the chariots, and at the fourth turn Ben Hur comes out the victor and is crowned with the wreath, to the great, chagrin of Messala, who is borne on a stretcher, wounded to death.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Harry T.

Armand at once falls in love with her, and as Marguerite is taken ill during the dancing, he is the only one who is taking care of her. In the second act the two have grown more familiar, although Marguerite has not quite given up her old acquaintances. One day, for instance, Armand has to leave her for the sake of a count, who has invited her for a drive. From the street Armand has watched the count's visit, and in a fit of passionate jealousy, he writes a letter to Marguerite, saying: \"I have seen the count enter your place. You must choose between him and me.\" Marguerite's friend gives her the letter. One minute later the agreement is made, and the count drives off alone. The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretending villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: \"All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard.\" One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face. Only once more the lovers meet again, at Marguerite's deathbed. Her only comfort is that Armand's father regrets his hard-heartedness and gives Armand permission to go back to her. He arrives just in time to see her die happy.

The promulgation of this fact draws to his office a most startling variety of monstrosities, all anxious to submit to his esoteric powers, whereby they hope to become Utopian as to face and figure. In his suite are a number of cabinets, in which the mere confining of the patient works wonders, transforming unsightly Calibans into beautiful Houris. The first to enter his chambre mysterieux is a tiny mite of femininity. The young lady is less than three feet tall, but under the professor's wonderful treatment she grows rapidly, and while she has now attained a condition of extreme pulchritude, she is placed in a most embarrassing position from the fact that as she grows tall and stately her gowns have remained le meme, reaching only to the knees. Oh, mercy! As an absolute antithesis of his first patient there appears a young girl who, though fair of face, must have been a lineal descendant from Teutobochus, the ancient giant king. She is at least eight feet tall and surely a \"line of sweetness long drawn out.\" Placing her under a pile-driver, the hammer of which balances 3,000 pounds, the professor hypnotizes her and starts the machine. Blow upon blow is rained on her shapely head until at last she emerges, a Naiad of symmetrical loveliness. Then comes a lady sporting a pair of pedal extremities that would surely cause Chicago to look to her laurels. These are quickly reduced from their amplitudinous dimensions to the possibility of a \"Louis Quinze.\" The proboscis next requires the professor's attention, a handsomely dressed society lady appearing with a marcel wave on her nose. But watch the professor! While he is engaged with this patient the Gargantuan form of a woman comes waddling in. She looks like a balloon and moves along with the grace of the car of Juggernaut. She echoes Hamlet's plea, \"O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!\" But Doc Skinum's the boy who knows what to do, and placing her on a stretcher, with a block and fall he lifts her onto the reducing table. He then turns on the current and through the pellucid vapor that arises we see the rapidly evanescent form of Elephantine Lizzie. The doctor having been called away by the lady with the distorted olfactory organ, whose footman had gotten into one of the cabinets and instantly changed to a policeman, forgets to turn off the fluid, and around goes the pointer on the indicator like the hand of a clepsydra, until, on his return, he finds poor Lizzie reduced to an infinitesimal modicum of her former self. In fact, she is about the size of a new-born infant. Here would be trouble for anyone but Skinum. So hurriedly placing her in the cabinet of beauty, she is transformed into a most charming duenna. These and many others are the amazing changes and cures performed by the old professor in the course of the film, which, as a whole, will prove a most effective cure for \"blues\" in the spectator whose good fortune it will be to view it, for it is unquestionably an assured laughing hit.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"14 Dec 1907","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Dr. Skinum","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The old nobleman wants to give a banquet in order to celebrate his daughter's betrothal to a rich old man of noble family. But his young and pretty daughter wants to have a younger and handsomer bridegroom, and therefore one can easily understand that she refuses the old suitor when the father introduces him to her. In the moonlight the young people meet and talk over their future prospects. He seems to feel inclined to give up the struggle and go away, but she is made of a sterner stuff and tries to prevent him in his intentions. As good luck would have it, the betrothal feast is to be held in the park by the seashore, and here Providence provides the accident which unites the two. The two rivals quarrel about a rose and the old gentleman settles the quarrel by saying that his daughter is to throw the rose into the water, and the one who fetches it up again shall have not only the rose but also the hand of his beautiful daughter and shall become the future owner of her magnificent castle home. In a second the young man is in the water, and while the spectators are shouting with joy he reaches the rose, which he at once offers to the fair judge. The old suitor has to acknowledge his adversary's strength and courage, and congratulates the two young people and withdraws his suit in favor of his successful rival.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Viggo Larsen","Released":"01 Oct 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"9 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Denmark","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"From the Rococo Times","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

As soon as he rubs the fluid off the mirror his double disappears. When the servant come in, a little of the fluid is again rubbed on the mirror, and he has the same experience, his reflection stepping out and doing stunts, thereby scaring the poor fellow almost to death. The inventor of the fluid then takes the mirror with him and goes out on the street, a passing policeman looks into it, and immediately his double appears and they have a free-for-all fight. A fellow playing the hose on the street is surprised when his double faces him, also holding a hose, and for a time it is amusing to see them drenching one another. He next goes into a café, where a man seated at a table gazes into the mirror, and immediately his double appears on the opposite side of the table, and it is nip and tuck to see who can eat the most. They cause so much excitement in the place that everything is wrecked and the unfortunate fellow is unceremoniously ejected, while his double disappears. The young inventor goes home, but is followed by an angry mob, who procure a vat and give him an undesired bath, and in the midst of the excitement the young student of chemicals awakens and finds that it is only a dream.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Segundo de Chomón, Ferdinand Zecca","Released":"28 Dec 1907","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"7 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Wonderful Mirrors","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"French","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Armand at once falls in love with her, and as Marguerite is taken ill during the dancing, he is the only one who is taking care of her. In the second act the two have grown more familiar, although Marguerite has not quite given up her old acquaintances. One day, for instance, Armand has to leave her for the sake of a count, who has invited her for a drive. From the street Armand has watched the count's visit, and in a fit of passionate jealousy, he writes a letter to Marguerite, saying: \"I have seen the count enter your place. You must choose between him and me.\" Marguerite's friend gives her the letter. One minute later the agreement is made, and the count drives off alone. The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretending villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: \"All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard.\" One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face. Only once more the lovers meet again, at Marguerite's deathbed. Her only comfort is that Armand's father regrets his hard-heartedness and gives Armand permission to go back to her. He arrives just in time to see her die happy.

The fact that they have been able to keep themselves innocent in spite of all temptation, as well as their beautiful appearance and winning ways, has drawn Baron d'Alroys' attention to them. He is paying special attention to Kitty, and as she is unable to conceal the passionate love she is bearing towards the Baron, it is not surprising that the Baron, one evening as he is fetching the two sisters from the music-hall in his motor-car, asks Kitty to marry him. Neither the sad circumstances in Kitty's home nor the obstacles which his family and friends of rank try to throw into his way, in order to make him give up this marriage, can induce him to desist from his purpose. He keeps his word and marries Kitty. Two years later we find a happy home; a sweet little girl seems to be an inviolable tie between man and wife in this unequal marriage. The idyll is interrupted by a servant, who is bringing instructions for the Baron to go to the colonial forces in Africa. With anxious forebodings for the future, man and wife part, he to face a precarious destiny, and she to spend many a sad and lonely day with her haughty mother-in-law. We see the Baron again at the head of the van, marching into the enemy's country. With a few of his men he falls in an ambush and is severely hurt. Another officer succeeds in getting away unhurt, but as he has seen the Baron falling without rising again, he supposes him to be dead and takes the sad message to his unhappy wife, as he a little later on is going home on leave of absence. The blow is terrible to the young wife; she has not only lost her husband, as far as she knows, but the mother-in-law now turns her away from the home. Kitty has now to endure much evil from her drunken father and her now so flighty sister. Her little girl is her only comfort. One fine day the old Baroness comes to visit her. She wants to take the child away from her. During the conflict which is now taking place between the two women. Baron d'Alroys himself, all alive, makes his appearance. Now matters are changed about. Kitty gets reparation for her misfortune and the wicked mother-in-law is unmercifully turned out. The Baron embraces his two beloved ones, as if he would never part from them again.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"02 May 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Denmark","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Misalliance","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

He wraps two women (who appear to be in a trance) in fabric, levitates them, and causes them to burst into flames and disappear. As he gathers their ashes in a pitcher a Good Spirit [a young woman who resembles Peter Pan] appears, shakes her head No, and reveals the \"souls\" of the two women in a secret compartment deeper within the cave. The Good Spirit vanishes in a puff of smoke. The magician then produces 3 glass bottles on pillars, takes them downstage close to the camera, and reveals 3 tiny women in them; one woman beats a tambourine while the other two sway. The magician pours ashes (?) into the bottles, but the Good Spirit reappears and makes these trapped figures disappear in a flash, angering the magician, who chases her away. He makes an easel appear. There is an odd sort of screen on it bearing the Pathe rooster logo. The magician then invents channel-surfing, causing three different \"shows\" to appear on the screen in rapid succession. The Good Spirit reappears and causes this strange television set to vanish, but the magician creates two more in turn, each more elaborate than the last, with various images of persons and dogs flashing across their screens. Finally, the Good Spirit reveals to the evil magician an area within the cave where there are four pillars and a tableau of distinguished-looking ladies (goddesses?). She takes the magician downstage, forces him to the ground, pours a pitcher of something on him (ashes? Holy water?) and turns him into a lifeless skeleton, which she reveals to the camera. Three tall flames appear in the foreground, and the film is over.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.7","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Segundo de Chomón, Ferdinand Zecca","Released":"17 Aug 1907","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"9 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"36","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Red Spectre","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Segundo de Chomón","Production":"N/A","Language":"French","tomatoUserMeter":"60"}

It starts with a scene showing the hunting party leaving Portland, Me., by train. They arrive at Millertown, N.F, where they are met by the guides, and from here the journey is made in canoes. Next is shown real camp life in the wilderness. The hunters start out in pursuit of the fleet-footed game, of which many are seen at remarkably close range. Several caribou are shot and taken in the course of the hunt. The excitement reaches a climax when one of the animals is run to the beach, and as he stands sniffing the air, a well-directed shot takes effect. Leaping forward, he plunges into the water, but a second shot follows and the magnificent caribou becomes the sportsman's trophy. This film is unquestionably an interesting hunting picture.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Documentary, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"08 Jun 1907","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Stalking and Shooting Caribou in Newfoundland","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Caught in a terrible storm in the Pacific Ocean, the vessel is wrecked and all on board are supposed to have been drowned, at least so the newspapers chronicled. What a blow this was to the young wife, waiting for her dear one's return. Although the evidence was apparently conclusive, still she could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had gone from her forever; something in her heart tells that he still lives, and in truth, for we see the poor shipwrecked mariner cast up by the seething sea on to a desert island in the Western Ocean. Here he spent seven long, weary years, worse off that De Foe's famous hero, \"Robinson Crusoe,\" for he at least enjoyed the companionship of \"Friday,\" but Davis was all alone. Now and then a distant sail, like a tantalizing phantom, would come into view and fade away again from sight, being too far off to see his signals of distress. His only solace was the picture in a locket of her who was waiting, waiting, ever hopeful of his return; praying as, indeed, was he also, their prayers ascending at the same time to the Father Almighty, through whose Grace and Mercy they were both imbued with hope, for although she finds her lot arduous, the care of a child being an exacting responsibility, she has repeatedly rejected the suit of Tom Foster, a good fellow, who would care for her and her little one. But no, that intuition tells her John will return, although it seems at times she hopes in vain. However, John's prayers are at last answered, and a boat is sent from a passing ship to his rescue. Returning home unannounced, the sight that greets him freezes his blood, for there he sees his wife and Foster walking through the garden accompanied by the child. He at once concludes that he has been forgotten and his place taken by his friend. His soul is at first filled with revenge and he is about to strike Foster down, but no, she is happy. She thinks him dead, and why not let it be so? This would be the most kindly, so he slinks hack into the foliage, intending to go away forever. They pass into the house, leaving the little one playing on the lawn. He cannot resist folding the child his child to his heart. From her he learns the truth as the mother returns from the house, and two faithful souls are \"once more united never to part.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Into her hands have fallen several theatrical newspapers, and she and her girl chum eagerly digest their contents, recounting in glowing terms what seems to be a golden existence. So wrought up were they that they immediately give vent to their ebullient spirits by indulging in a quasi-dramatic performance. This is a scene of broad burlesque, and, during its enaction, the minister enters and is greatly shocked, not to say incensed. A stormy scene occurs between him and his daughter, which ends with her leaving home. She applies for a position in the chorus of a New York opera company. What a contrast she makes at the trial of voices, but with determination she pulls through the ordeal and is accepted. Owing to her sweet face and manners, together with a beautiful voice, her rise in the profession is rapid. Still, she has found that all is not gold that glitters, and while her artistic success is most agreeable, life for her is empty, cold and cheerless, made more odious by the appearance of the inevitable vile, flattering tempter. Numerous letters has she written to her dear old father, but no response, for he has torn them into shreds before he even broke the seal. \"Oh, God, if I could only go back. If this all would prove but a dream.\" But, no, there is the dark fathomless future before her. The tempter would have her go with him, and there seems to be no alternative. She is now surely at the crossroads of life. She makes a final appeal to her father in a telegram begging him to come to see her performance on the night following, which he does. Down the aisle of the theater comes the old minister in bewilderment, so unaccustomed is he to the surroundings, as through the peekhole in the curtain drops the girl views the scene in ecstasy. After the performance the old man makes his way to the back of the stage, where he once more folds his daughter to his heart, while her would-be lover views the scene with unconcealed chagrin. The story is a most touching one.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon Jr.","Released":"03 Jul 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"At the Crossroads of Life","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"D.W.

Her one hobby was to possess a hubby. Many there were whom she tried to hook, but in vain, for truth to say. Arte was of pulchritude a bit shy. She had the complexion of pale rhubarb and a figure like a wheat sack. Still her motto was \"nil desperandum,\" and she was ever hopeful. One thing in her favor, her father. Obediah Stebbins, avowed his aid. Of the visitors who called at the Stebbins' domicile, Hezekiah Horubeak seemed the most probable to corral, so Artemisia set to work. Hez at first was a trifle recalcitrant, but was soon subdued by Obediah's gun, which we must admit possessed egregious powers of persuasion. The day for the wedding was set, and to the village church there flocked the natives to witness this momentous affair. All was progressing serenely until the all-important question was put to Hezekiah, and instead of answering \"Yea,\" he kicked over the trace and tried to beat it. His escape by way of the door was intercepted, so it happens that the little church is in sore need of a stained glass window, for Hez took a portion of it with him in his haste. Out and over the lawn he gallops with the congregation at his heels, Artemisia Sophia well in the lead. Down from the terrace onto the road they leap and across the meadow until they come to a fence, on the other side of which are two boys shooting crap. Over this hurdle they vault coming plump down on the poor boys, almost crushing the life out of them. Regaining his equilibrium, Hez forges on coming to the very acropolis of the town. The descent therefrom is decidedly precipitous and makes Hez hesitate for a moment, but only a moment, for the howling horde is still in pursuit, so down be goes in leaps and falls to the bottom, followed by a veritable avalanche of human beings. Owing to this mix-up Hez has a chance to distance them a little, and being almost exhausted, he attempts to climb a tree, but too late for the gang is soon upon him, and carry him back to the church where the ceremony is started again, and when he is asked that all-important question he fairly yells, \"Yes, b'gosh!\" Artemisia is now asked the question, and to the amazement of all present she says, \"Not on your county fair tintype,\" and flounces haughtily out of the church, leaving poor Hezekiah in a state of utter collapse, surrounded by sympathizing friends.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The hills of Southern Spain were infested by a gang of lawless freebooters who terrorized the country and made travel in the mountains a hazardous pastime. They waylaid, robbed and often murdered the unwary tourist who chanced their way. In the opening of this Biograph picture a party of these Andalusian bushrangers, in command of their chieftain, are seen hiding behind a huge rock in waiting for prey. They haven't long to wait, for after having held up and relieved several pedestrians, a stylish landau approaches in which are seated an old gentleman, a duenna, and a pretty young Senora. The inevitable happens; all are relieved of their valuables, and while the gentleman and duenna are sent on their way, the girl is held a prisoner. She realizes her helplessness, and at the same time assumes that her beauty has made an impression on the chief, hence resorts to woman's wiles to captivate the bandit. In this she succeeds, but must use strategy to regain her jewels, which are still in his possession. Her subtle artifice is promising, when they are surprised by the police, who take them in hand, but the sergeant finding them possessed of so much wealth, is content to take that and let them go. From here they go to the mountain inn, where later the sergeant again puts in an appearance, so Senora bribes the waiting maid to allow her to act in that capacity, and as the sergeant does not recognize her, she having been veiled when they met in the road, he is lured to a private room, where he is overpowered, bound and gagged by the bandit, who regains the jewels, and with Senora flees to another hostelry. Here Senora piles her conquest with cajolery and wine until he falls into a drunken sleep. Now is her chance. She secures her jewelry and after leaving a derisive letter for the enamored bandit, departs to rejoin her friends, chuckling in anticipation of the chagrin of the pillager upon his awakening.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Action","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

A knock at the door signals the entrance of the call-boy, with a note from the manager to say that she must come at once to the theater or suffer the loss of her position, a thing she can ill afford, as it furnishes the only revenue, meager as it is, with which she maintains her little home. Madly rushing to the theater, she hastens into her costume and appears at the entrance just as the curtain rises. Here is the crucial test of the actor's art. With heart as heavy as stone, she trips on to be greeted by the thousand smiling faces of pleasure-seekers in anxious anticipation of her dance, which is a feature of the performance. The dance over, she exits to be met by her mother, who has been sent by the doctor to bid her hurry home if she would see her loved one alive. Meanwhile there are storms of applause from an insistent public, soliciting an encore; hence she is aroused from her apparent lethargy by the stage manager, who fairly pushes her back on the stage. Again before the audience, her art befriends her, but in the course of the dance a mother's intuition asserts itself and in her mind's eye she sees her little one, but only for a moment, for the audience is thrown into a wild tumult, which tends to recall her to the exigencies of her position, and so she finishes the number. Dashing wildly from the theater to her home, she arrives, but too late. For when she meets the kind-hearted doctor at the door, her worst fears are confirmed. The scene that follows positively defies description, and we can only say that it is unquestionably the most powerful ever shown in motion pictures.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Miss Vane is playing in wretched luck, and is advised several times by Mrs. Wharton to desist, but she still plays on in the vain hopes of the tide of fortune turning, until at last, in the extreme of desperation, she stakes her all and loses. Shame and disgrace stare her in the face. What can she do to recoup her depleted fortune? As one of the guests there is Professor Francois Paracelsus, the eminent palmister, who of course, was called upon to read the palms of those present. Sheets of paper were prepared and each imprinted their hand on a sheet to be read by the erudite soothsayer at his leisure, and so were left on the drawing room table. All have now retired to the apartments assigned them by Mrs. Wharton, but there seems to be a sleepless night before Myrtle, and she suffers mental agony, until the thought of the necklace flashes before her mind's eye. 0, if she only possessed those treasures all would be well. The more she thought of it the more unconquerable became her covetousness, until the inimitable determination to secure them seized her, but how? To enter her room by the door would not only arouse the hostess, but maybe the guests as well. There was but one way, by the window, and this undertaking was decidedly hazardous, for it meant that she must crawl along the narrow ledge between her window and that of Mrs. Wharton, a distance of twenty feet, and one slight misstep would result in her being dashed to death on the walk below. But when a woman will, so she makes the trip without mishap, entering the room she searches noiselessly for the top of the dresser, finds it, secures the necklace, and makes her way back to her apartment. Now to hide the jewels. An ingenious idea strikes her. She cuts in two a bar of soap, and hollowing it out, places the treasure inside and joins the parts together. Meanwhile Mrs. Wharton, aroused from her slumber, intuitively looks to her diamonds, but finds them gone. \"What's this? A clue!\" On the dresser there is a sheet of the palmister's paper on which there is a handprint of dust. Down to the drawing room for the corresponding imprint. There it is, and signed \"Myrtle Vane.\" To Miss Vane's room goes the furious Mrs. Wharton, and during the scene that transpires the soap is brushed from the table and breaks open, exposing the necklace, at the same time convicting the poor girl. Upon the recovery of her jewels, Mrs. Wharton's anger subsides and she is inclined to be charitable towards the unfortunate girl kneeling at her feet, so she not only forgives her, but insists upon aiding her financially.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Crime","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

At a reception given in his honor by Lieut. Penrose, an Indian agent, the civilized brave meets Gladys, the lieutenant's daughter, and falls desperately in love with her. You may be sure he is indignantly repulsed by Gladys and ordered from the house for his presumption by her father. With pique he leaves, and we next find him in his own room, crushed and disappointed, for he realizes the truth: \"Good enough as a hero, but not as a husband.\" What was the use of his struggle? As he reasons, his long suppressed nature asserts itself and he hears the call of the wild: \"Out there is your sphere, on the boundless plains, careless and free, among your kind and kin, where all is truth.\" Here he sits; this nostalgic fever growing more intense every second, until in a fury he tears off the conventional clothes he wears, donning in their stead his suit of leather, with blanket and feathered headgear. Thus garbed, and with a bottle of whiskey, he makes his way back to his former associates in the wilds. He plans vengeance and the opportunity presents itself, when he surprises Gladys out horseback riding. He captures her after a spirited chase and intended holding her captive, but she appeals to him, calling to his mind the presence of the All Powerful Master above, who knows and sees all things, and who is even now calling to him to do right. He listens to the call of this Higher Voice, and helping her to her saddle, sadly watches her ride off homeward.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Action","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The little one asks her mother if Santa Clans is coming, to which the poor, almost heartbroken woman is unable to answer. The baby then says, \"I'll write him a letter to be sure to come.\" And so she writes on a scrap of paper, \"Dear Santa, please don't forget little Margie. Me and mamma ain't got no food even. Little Margie, 114 Broome St., top floor.\" This she shows her mother who is unable to control her emotion. Baby then hangs up her stocking, putting the letter in it. When the little one is asleep, the mother takes the note, and reading it, is driven almost mad with helplessness. With the child's missive clutched in her hand, she takes up her cloak and hurries to the pawnshop, which is presided over by Mike McLaren, an Irish pawnbroker. Mike's reputation as a philanthropist is not very pronounced. On the contrary as we see him he appears to be a cruel, pitiless Hibernian, without a grain of charity in his makeup. Ah! but who can reckon the power of the Christmas spirit. Mrs. Martin enters Mike's place and proffers her cloak as a pledge for a few cents, but Mike throws the cloak back at her with an invective. It is worth nothing to him, so he will allow her nothing. In her mental agony she absent-mindedly drops the baby's letter on the floor. Mike picks this up alter she leaves. What a change comes over him as he reads the child's innocent appeal. Hustling his clerks about, he bids them buy a Christmas tree, ornaments, toys and provisions. This done, he enlists the service of a couple of burglars, who burglarize Mrs. Martin's apartment, slightly chloroforming her and her child, so as to be sure of their not waking while they are at work. In comes the clerk with the tree and presents, which Mike arranges, and when finished, he goes out into the hall to watch the effect. He hasn't long to wait, and he dances around like a child at the view he gets through the keyhole, hurrying off before the inmates learn from whence their blessing came. The little one attributes it to her letter to Santa, and in truth it was, but they never knew the real Santa. \"To dry up a single tear has more of honest fame than shedding seas of gore.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

They are classmates, roommates and players on the college football team, and being stalwart, athletic youths, have won hearty encomiums from the spectators for their superb work on the \"gridiron.\" They were the fastest of friends until a young girl appeared and by the workings of cruel fate was beloved by both. Now the golden woof in the weave of friendship becomes badly tangled, as we shall see. The girl has given her heart to one of the classmates, unknown to the other, who meets her for the first time at the football game, by the way, a most spirited scene, showing the team's quarters and then the actual game, which is undoubtedly the finest ever photographed. The graduation exercises follow and are attended by the highest dignitaries of Church and State, prominent among whom will be seen President Roosevelt, Bishop Potter, Seth Low, etc. This is followed in time by the graduation ball, during the course of which there is a confetti dance. This, without exception, is the most beautiful scene ever shown in motion pictures. As the dance progresses the dancers are showered with a veritable blizzard of tiny stars and ribbons, producing an effect simply indescribable. It is during these festivities that the youth confesses his love for the girl, and is plunged into the depths of despair when told that her heart is another's, his chum. How coldly do the classmates part, when the next day they start on their divergent paths of life. The unsuccessful suitor to the West, where he engages in mining pursuits, and the other to the metropolis of the East, becoming a successful financier, the owner of fast horses and, above all, the liege lord of the fair charmer. Two years later the Westerner is drawn on business East, and meets his old classmate. The dead coals of their friendship are mildly rekindled and an invitation accepted to visit the Easterner's home. While the trio are enjoying a pleasant chat over old times, an urgent message calls the husband to his stable on account of the illness of his most valuable racer, leaving his wife to entertain his chum until his return. The chum takes advantage of his absence to renew his protestations of love, which are spurned by the wife, who, when he becomes persistent, attempts to avoid him, mounting the stairs leading to the upper floor. He follows, whereupon the wife, with a well-directed blow, sends him reeling down the stairs, crashing through the balustrade to the floor below, just as the husband reenters, amazed at the sight. The woman's denunciation of the false friend brings about a terrific combat. About the room they struggle, smashing furniture and bric-a-brac to atoms, until the husband lands a powerful blow upon his adversary, dropping him like a log. He picks up a chair and would brain him but for his wife, who leaps between them, forming a picture and finish to a film story seldom, if ever, equaled.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"01 Feb 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Classmates","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

She notices its absence while seated at the banquet board and is very much wrought up in consequence, but Mr. Brown assures her that she will find it safe upon their return home. As one of the guests, there is a party named Wells, who, unknown to all, is a gentleman burglar. Hearing of the forgotten necklace, he sees the chance of a rich haul, and feigning illness, leaves the banquet hall, makes his way to the Brown apartments and is just about to decamp with the loot, when the Browns return; so he hides behind the portieres that cover the window, leaving the necklace lying on the dresser. Brown is a bit boozy, and goes out again, ostensibly to procure cigars. While he is gone, Mrs. Brown retires. Wells seizes this opportunity to get out, but hearing the approach of Brown, compels Mrs. Brown to hide him, or he will pretend to her husband that he is her lover. Here is a dilemma. Well, she conceals him in the closet. Brown enters, and taking off his coat goes to the closet to hang it up, and it looks for the moment that a discovery is inevitable, so Wells sneaks from there, and after ineffectually seeking a place of safety for some minutes, is finally caught. He throws suspicion on poor Mrs. Brown, who in vain tries to convince her husband the fellow is a thief. Finally the husband hands her a pistol and commands her to shoot her lover, or thief, whichever he be. This the wife is loath to do, but as Wells raises a gun and is about to shoot her husband, she sends a bullet through his wrist, dropping the gun from his hand. At this moment a couple of policemen, who had heard the skirmish, rush in and secure Wells, in whose pockets are found many articles of value, proving conclusively his true character. Brown now shamefacedly implores the forgiveness of his wife for his suspicious.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

But, alas! he is human, and in his employ is a very beautiful girl as model. This girl has loved her employer with a suppressed, hopeless passion, which needed but a breath to fan it into a blaze. In justice to her it must be said that she didn't realize the strength of this feeling, smothering it with admiration for the artist's devotion for his wife. Ah, but the Devil knows how to play the game, and his promptings are so fascinatingly impressive that few can resist. But who is the Devil? He is the embodiment of our evil inclination warring with the pure. So it was that at his prompting the artist falls, as does his model. They are discovered by the wife, who in turn is prompted by the Devil to \"get even,\" which she heeds. She is surprised by her husband in a private dining-room of a café in company with a gentleman friend. In frenzy he leaps at his wife's throat, and the Devil laughs. He would have sent her to him then and there, hut for the intervention of the waiters. In terror, the poor woman rushes to her home. She is followed by the crazed husband. In vain she pleads, but the Devil prompts: \"Kill.\" Taking a revolver from the dresser-drawer, he moves deliberately toward the terrified wife, and the Devil laughs. A shot and a body and soul part; another shot, and \"There was the Devil to pay,\" and he collected. This subject, while thrilling, is most ingeniously handled, with photographic quality of the highest order, showing a stereoscopic effect never before attained.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Life on the field of battle and their capture as prisoners of war is next shown. While incarcerated in the foul military prison, the poor creatures are subjected to many indignities that even a dog would resent and during the six months of their confinement they industriously bore through the earth under the dungeon, with no other tools than their fingers, until they tunnel their way to liberty.

Pong writes Hendricks that he has need for five young girls, and so Hendricks sets out to secure them. Visiting a rural district, he has no trouble, by his glib, affable manner, in gaining the confidence of several young and pretty girls. Pong is on hand with a closed carriage to bag the prey. One of the girls, as she is seized, emits a yell that alarms the neighborhood and brings to the scene several policemen and a couple of detectives, who have long been on the lookout for these caitiffs. The Chinese get away with the carriage, however, and Hendricks by subterfuge throws the police on the wrong scent. One of the detectives is a woman, and possessed of shrewd powers of deduction, hence does not swallow the bald story of the villain, and exercises her natural acumen with success. She shadows Hendricks, and by means of a flirtation inveigles him to a restaurant, where she succeeds in doping his drink. He falls asleep and she secures the letter written by Pong, which discloses the hiding place of the Chinaman. This she immediately telephones to the police, and while so doing Hendricks awakes and starts off to warn his friends. He arrives at the old deserted house ahead of the police, but escape is impossible, so the police rescue the girls, but fail to secure Pong and Hendricks, who afterwards seize the girl detective, and taking her to the house, tie her to a post and arrange a large pistol on the face of a clock in such a way that when the hands point to twelve the gun is fired and the girl will receive the charge. Twenty minutes are allowed for them to get away, for the hands are now indicating 11:40. Certain death seems to be her fate, and would have been had not an accident disclosed her plight. Hendricks after leaving the place is thrown by a street car, and this serves to discover his identity, so he is captured and a wild ride is made to the house in which the poor girl is incarcerated. This incident is shown in alternate scenes. There is the helpless girl, with the clock ticking its way towards her destruction, and out on the road is the carriage, tearing along at breakneck speed to the rescue, arriving just in time to get her safely out of range of the pistol as it goes off. In conclusion we can promise this to be an exceedingly thrilling film, of more than ordinary interest.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Crime","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Even Mrs. Wilkins, who is as vivacious as a widow, snubs him. He keenly feels his condition and resolves to alter it. With this in view, he enlists the services of Professor Dyem, the celebrated Dermatologist and Tonsorial Artist. After a session with the Professor, beheld the transmogrified Wilkins. What a change! Shorn of his grizzly beard, his locks raven, complexion florid, eye clear and step elastic, he views himself in the mirror. He hardly recognizes himself. In fact, it requires his valet to convince him that he is he. \"Am I in it? Well. I guess. If I don't keep up with and even beat that bandwagon by a city block, my name is not Pill Wilkins.\" He sallies forth and makes for the park. The first person he encounters is his wife. He approaches her in elation, but she mistakes him for an impudent masher and he receives the weight of her parasol over his head for his trouble. The next one he meets is his daughter. She is seated on a bench, waiting for Charley. He takes a seat beside her and when he tries to make himself known she draws herself up to full height and with a blow sends him backward over the bench onto the grass. Well, he changes his tactics, and gets reckless. Along comes his son with his best girl, so he decides to win her out for spite. Now this young lady has a sensitive pneumogastric nerve, and when he sits beside her on the bench and slyly suggests a cold bottle and a hot bird, she is \"his'n.\" This is done so coolly and so quickly, that young Wilkins, who, of course, does not recognize his respected papa, is speechless with rage. He follows them, however, to the café, where his intrusion is resented and he is rudely thrown from the place. At the Wilkins' domicile there is an indignation meeting. Mother, daughter and son all rush in to relate their experiences to father. He is not to be found. Suddenly a hilarious individual enters. \"'Tis he, the insulter: a drunk and disorderly.\" They are about to have him thrown out when the valet comes to his rescue and explains that the jubilant gentleman is no other than their dear papa, who has not only caught up with the bandwagon, but is sitting on the seat with the driver.

The little ones, however, in their childish innocence, could not appreciate the odium of their elders, and Bobby Wilkinson and Nellie Caulfield became child lovers. This incensed Colonel Wilkinson, who tore the children apart, ordered Bobby never to be seen in her company again. The Colonel's action ignited the ire of the Caulfields and a furious conflict ensued, resulting in the shooting to death of George, the Colonel's youngest son, a boy of fourteen. From that time on the clans kept strictly to themselves. But love knows no clannishness, and, despite family hatred, Bob and Nellie remained lovers. After ten years, driven to desperation by this apparently insurmountable barrier, they elope and are married. Bob decides to brave the storm of his father's anger and present his wife, but the old Colonel drives him from the house, disowning him. Old Aunt Dinah and Uncle Daniel, the colored servants, were so attached to the young folks that they go with them. Two years later we find the little family, now increased by an infant son, having a hard of it. It is Christmas morning and no turkey for dinner. Old Aunt Dinah, believing in the efficacy of prayer, gets down on her knees in the kitchen to ask the good Lord to send them a bird. Uncle Daniel, touched by this demonstration of faith, takes a gun and determines to get a turkey at any hazard. Over the hills he goes, but his journey is hopelessly fruitless until he comes to the rear of the Colonel's house. Tillie, the cook, has just hung a fat turkey on a post outside the kitchen door. When Daniel sees it he can't resist the temptation. Back home he hustles and finds Dinah still at prayer, he lays the fowl on the floor beside her and sneaks out. When Dinah sees it she surely thinks it was due to her prayers. Well, the turkey is cooked and an old-fashioned Christmas anticipated. Meanwhile the Colonel has discovered his loss and tracks the thief to Bob's estate. Entering, a tragedy seems inevitable, but when the old Colonel sees the young one, his grandson, in the cradle, his heart goes out to it and the feud ends then and there.

They take frequent pulls from a brandy bottle on the table between them. The door opens and Mimi, a very pretty girl, thin and pale, enters, carrying a basket of flowers on her arm. She comes timidly forward. Bambard rises to his feet, staggers toward her in a half-drunken manner, points to her full basket of flowers, roughly pushes her and orders her out again. She sinks exhausted on a chair and pleads for a rest, but Bambard strikes her and forces her out the door. The two thieves resume their conversation, and after a while gather some burglar tools, leaving mother Martin, another member of the gang, in charge and depart. The flower girl wanders along to a fashionable part of the city, meeting with but little success in disposing of her flowers. An automobile dashes up, and Rene Masson, a handsome young man, alights. Mimi offers him a bunch of flowers. He looks at her face, takes them and gives in return several bank notes. At this moment the girl is seized with a sudden faintness, staggers and would have fallen had not the young man caught her. He places her in his auto and starts for home. Bambard and Pigord, who have been watching from across the street, start off in the same direction. The young man reaches his apartments, carries in the unconscious girl and places her on a couch. Forcing some wine between her lips, the girl soon revives and opens her eyes in wonderment. She is given food and drink, recovers from her faintness and asks to go. Her protector accompanies her and they have scarcely left the room when Bambard and Pigord enter, ransack the place, carrying away bank notes, jewels, plate, etc. They proceed to their den, tell of their escapade, also of the fainting of Mimi. A plan is conceived to lure the young man to the den and a note dispatched offering to return the plunder for a cash ransom, and signed the flower girl. Rene receives the decoy letter, takes a roll of bank notes, his revolver and departs. Mimi returns to the rendezvous, learns of the robbery and also of the plan to trap the young millionaire and determines to save him. She eludes mother Martin, jumps from the window and hurries to the police inspector, and, with several officers, starts for the gang's headquarters. Meanwhile the young millionaire proceeds to the address given, and as he crosses the threshold, the thieves spring upon him, overpower and bind him. Bambard, after securing the young man's money, points his revolver at Rene's head. As he fires, the door flies open and Mimi jumps in front of Rene and receives the bullet instead of him. The officers follow and after a short struggle the gang is overpowered and taken away. Rene's bonds are removed. He rushes over to the flower girl, raises her in his arms, she looks up with a smile, presses his hand and falls back dead.

Two denizens of the underworld are seen in their squalid furnished room planning a robbery. Their intended victim is known to hold at all times in his safe at home a large sum of money and a wealth of jewels. Gathering together the tools of their nefarious calling, they start off, arriving at the house shortly after the master had retired for the night. Entrance is easily and noiselessly effected. A chloroform-soaked handkerchief soon puts the master beyond the power of interfering and the safe is broken open. The sight that greets them almost makes them gasp. There in this strong box is not only an enormous sum of money, but many valuable jewels as well, prominent among which is a handsome diamond necklace. All this is put into a cloth, and a hurried egress made. Back to their room they go to divide the spoils of their night's haul. The diamond necklace being an indivisible article, a contention is at once raised between the partners in crime. There is no way in which they seem able one to satisfy the other, so they drop the argument for the time being to eat lunch. One, to make sure that he shall be the possessor of the loot, drops poison in the coffee of his chum, Which he drinks, and is soon in the throes of convulsions, falling to the floor lifeless, while the other stands by sardonically gloating over his seeming victory; but his elation is short-lived, for he is now seized with the same agony and pitches forward alongside his partner.

He places the money temporarily in his desk and prepares for his journey, excusing himself to Wilson, at the same time begging him to make himself at home, he departs. Now with the family there was employed a French maid, whose carelessness just before this scene, incurred the displeasure of Mrs. Robertson, who discharged her. Wilson is a bank cashier and has fallen into the error of so many of his kind. As his peculations are detected, and well-grounded rumors already rife, he comes to ask the wise counsel of his friends. Robertson having departed, Wilson hesitatingly unburdens his mind to Mrs. Robertson, who, of course, is amazed at his recital. While they are engaged in whispered conversation, the maid, who has packed her belongings to leave, peeks in. An idea strikes her: a chance too good to lose, so she noiselessly reverses the key in the door and locks it from the outside, thus leaving the couple prisoners. Out of the house she rushes to overtake Robertson, which she does at the next corner. Loud and impressive are her defamations, which not only arouse the jealousy of the husband, but curiosity of the passersby as well. Back to the house dashes Robertson and upon finding the door locked, the maid's story seems only too true. Inside the room consternation had at first seized the couple, and then the wife accuses Wilson of duplicity: \"No, no! Not that! I'm not as low as that, but we must think, and think quickly. Ah! Go into that room.\" The wife does as he commands and Wilson makes for the desk, bursts it open and is taking the money as Robertson, in a frenzy, crashes into the room. He slops short at the scene that greets his sight. There is his wife, whom he had for the moment doubted, coming from her room, and his most cherished friend standing over the wrecked desk with the implicating bank notes still in his hand. For an instant all seemed paralyzed: then from the husband: \"Go.\" Wilson, with bowed head, leaves. He has chosen to hurl himself into the slough of degradation to save the honor of his friend's wife.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

At any rate, they all feared him, as he, with them, terrorized the whole country 'round, by acts of pillage, arson and worse. Bill, despite his black nature, was a handsome fellow, who, under different conditions, might be called attractive. This the case, there is reason why Nellie Carson, a girl of the frontier, should fall so violently in love with him, casting her lot with his. She soon finds out his true nature, but even then she seems to be held by an irresistible power, though, he would cast her off, which he tries to do, leaving her lying wounded and insensible in the road, after a stormy scene between them. She is discovered by a girl of the mountains, who offers to help her to her mountain home. Though moved by the girl's kindness, she rejects her offer, choosing to go her own way on the road of life she has picked out. The mountain girl drives off and is waylaid by Bill, who seizes her and brings her to his camp. Nellie, coming along later, discovers evidence of what has taken place, and with a feeling of pity for the girl, and jealousy of Bill, resolves to save her. She arrives at camp at nightfall and manages to release the girl and get away, but unfortunately her revolver drops to the ground, and exploding, awakens the gang. The girl's plight looks bad for the instant, and would have been disastrous had not one of the Indians, who had always shown a weakness for Nellie, handicapped Bill. This enabled the girls, who mounted the one horse, to get a lead. However, Bill and his red devils are fast gaining on them, and several of his bullets have taken effect in poor Nellie's body, who has sacrificially placed herself between the mountain girl and Bill. The girl's apprehension seems inevitable, when the Indian rides up, and Bill, with a dagger wound in the breast, falls from his horse, thereby closing his contemptible career. This in a measure demoralizes the gang, and the girls reach the mountaineer's cabin, but Nellie is mortally wounded and expires as she is taken from the horse, the good Indian driving up just in time to claim her body that he might bury it. This subject is an exceptionally thrilling one, with photography of the highest order, and many of the scenes tinted.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Action, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

However, pretty little O Yama Sum had a will of her own, and casting tradition to the winds, insisted upon making her own choice. The Grand Daimio has long loved the pretty O Yama and presents himself before her mother in quest of her hand. His offer is scorned by O Yama, for she loves another, a low-born but worthy warrior. She writes to him to meet her by the Great Lamp of Savatiya that night, and they are nearly caught through the treachery of one of the butterflies of the court, who tells the Daimio of his rival. The lover escapes by hiding in the great lamp and afterwards being conveyed in a large hamper to the Bower of Roses, where he is eventually captured and thrown into the torture chamber. The Daimio, to render his revenge more complete, conveys to O Yama a false message from her lover, with his, the Daimio's, permission to see him. She is conducted to the chamber, and the sight that greets her fairly paralyzes her; for here is her lover hung by the wrists, dangling over a treacherous bed of upturned knife-blades, which inflict ugly wounds at the slightest move of his body. Besides this, there is a sword lying across a fire to be used at order from the Daimio. Here the Daimio gives poor O Yama her choice between her marriage with him or her lover's torture. But the brave warrior urges her to refuse. The sword, now incandescently hot, is applied to his breast, leaving great red scars, but he is still obdurate, until at length he is cut down and expires in the arms of O Yama. As he fails, his dagger drops to the floor, and O Yama, unobserved, conceals it in her obi. Then, turning to the Daimio, she consents to become his bride. He, delighted by her apparent change of heart, orders the preparations for the wedding to be made at once, which, according to Japanese custom, is to take place just before sundown. There in the wedding hall are assembled the courtiers and butterflies, when enter the priest, or \"Marrier,\" as he is called, followed by O Yama, her mother and the Daimio. The Daimio, his bride-elect, and her mother take their places on the cushions, while the Marrier pours the sake, handing the cup first to the mother, then to the Daimio, who both drink of the wine, and finally to O Yama, who, instead of drinking, whips the dagger from her obi, plunges it deep into the heart of the Daimio, who drops like a log, dead at her feet, and before anyone can intervene she performs the happy dispatch with the same bodkin, so concluding a film story that is not only a most exciting and novel one, but extremely picturesque as well.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Hence it was that he hailed with keen delight the opportunity of taking a day off. No other arrangement was made than to spend the day as one of absolute rest at home. How well he succeeded is most lucidly shown in this Biograph film. It is during May, and we know what transpires in all well-regulated households during this month, and with cruel coincidence, his holiday and general house-cleaning were set for the same day. Jones starts in all right. He takes a fine cigar, the morning paper, selects the easiest chair in the parlor, and assumes for the nonce the air of a gentleman of leisure. But, alas, his beatific dream was rudely disturbed by Wifey: \"John, dear, I really cannot get this stovepipe back in place; it doesn't seem to fit.\" Well, we know what a prolix undertaking this is. John struggled and swore, fretted and fussed, until down came the whole affair, covering him with a suit of soot from head to feet. A bath is next in order. Having divested himself of this ebony complexion, he is back in the parlor, but hardly seated, when Mrs. Jones calls him to the kitchen to fix the water pipe. He succeeds only in getting a thorough drenching, and once more a change of apparel is necessary. This being done, his wife now demands he hang a picture. \"Ah, let us alone.\" But Wifey insists. A stepladder is brought in and Jones ascends it, armed with hammer and nails, with a large picture frame under his arm. The nail is held in position, and, \"Why, John!\" says Wifey, \"such language, and before baby.\" John had aimed the hammer at the nail head, but hit his thumb. Another blow, more vigorous than the first, is sent, \"Gee, whiz, twice in the same place. Biddy Mulligan.\" Jones, with a yell of pain, leaps in the air and there is a mad race between his head and the picture frame for the floor; it was a dead heat. Wifey is awfully sorry, and allows him to pacify and amuse himself with minding the baby, a delicate attention on her part. Still, it might be worse, and soon it is, for Wifey's voice is heard calling, \"John, dear, the gas is leaking.\" Jones, with a lighted candle, goes into the cellar in search of the leak, and finds it; and when the smoke and dust of the explosion clears away, poor John is seen stretched out on the cellar floor. Oh, but what's the use? John was given a day of rest by the boss, and he rests with a vengeance.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"29 May 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"His Day of Rest","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Frank E.

But alas, Hulda was a fickle maid, and seemed to have as many phases as the moon, with a smile for all and a frown for none. Her capriciousness was the cause of much unrest, both for herself and her lovers, for when her parents had departed for a visit, leaving her in charge of the kitchen, she received most effusively Jocular Jake, the village cut-up, only to hide him above stairs at the entrance of Previous-Hearted Pat, the hostler, who in turn is hidden in the Dutch oven at the approach of Handy Hank, the chore boy. Now Hank has long loved the fair Hulda, but, gol darn it, somehow or other he just can't tell her, and so he puts it off. The next to arrive is Asinine Alfred, the city chap. He makes quite a hit, but again an interruption sends him unwillingly to the wood box. \"Drat it all!\" It is only Hank with an armful of wood, which he throws in on the unfortunate Alfred.

He would have procured some of the mysterious fluid compounded by an erudite scientist by which things animate and inanimate were rendered non est, for ten minutes at least, by simply spraying them with it. In an atomizer, he sends a quantity, accompanied by a letter, to his brother. In the hope of his putting it on the market. The brother regards it as a joke, and, while toying with the atomizer, accidentally sprays himself. Presto! he is gone, to the amazement of the messenger boy who has carried the package thither. The boy reads the letter, and at once sees the amount of fun he can get out of it, so he nips it. Strolling along the avenue is a young girl, leading a dog by a chain. Swish! and a dangling chain is all that is left with the girl. Next, a Dago with a fruit stand: first, the fruit stand is made to disappear, then the Dago himself. Two expressmen are lifting a heavy trunk from their wagon when the boy appears. Same result, trunk vamooses, as do the expressmen, with another squirt of the fluid. A wedding party is just leaving church when this young imp comes along. The groom vanishes, and the bride is thrown into hysterics. Into the park be meanders, and many and ludicrous are the tricks he plays. Finally, he enters a restaurant, and, after almost throwing the place into a panic, goes to pay his cheek, but, instead, he, with one spray, obliterates the young lady cashier and then steals the cash register. He is now chased by a mob of his victims, who have by this time overcome the influence of the fluid and become reincarnate. Halting on the road, he turns on his pursuers and effects their disappearance one after another as they approach him. A copper steals up from behind, and, taken unawares, he is carried off to the station house. With a policeman on each aide of him, he appears before the judge. Picking up the atomizer, he gives it a squeeze and vanishes instantly, leaving the judge and officers dumbfounded.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"16 Jun 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"12 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Invisible Fluid","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Griffith","Plot":"\"Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast.\" Not always, but sometimes. Hence it was that the dulcet tones produced by Heinie Holtzmeyer, the fiddler, and Orpheus of the little Holland Village, failed to tranquilize his wife Lena, who was rather a Xantippe than an Eurydice, and Heinie's head, like that of Socrates, often played the target for her pots and pans, and her aim was very good. The poor fellow sought solace at the public house, where he met the toss-pots of the town, and right merry souls were they. His fiddle made him a favorite with all, especially the barmaids, who rewarded his efforts with wine and kisses. His joys, however, are of short duration, for Lena appears, and, brandishing a rolling-pin, clears out the place. Heinie rushes home, packs his bag and, with his fiddle, decamps. He is followed by Lena until he reaches the wharf, where he finds himself, as it were, \"between the devil and the deep sea,\" so he chooses the sea. Jumping into a row-boat he rows to an outgoing vessel, ships and is off for parts unknown. A storm is encountered, and the vessel is wrecked, but fortune favors and he is cast ashore. Heinie is about to give thanks for his deliverance when he is pounced upon by an army of ferocious cannibals, armed with clubs and excaliburs, now wouldn't that discombobulate you? Well, it looked like Stew à la Hollandaise for Heinie. And indeed, the black warriors are about to prepare a Dutch dinner, when the Queen does the Pocahontas act and, throwing herself on the prostrate form of Heinie, declares that they shall strike him only through her. So they desist, for such a thing would be impossible, as the Queen is so thick through, that the longest spear would hardly reach the victim. In fact, she is that obese she looks like a crowd. Heinie now takes his fiddle and discourses sweet music, which places him in such high esteem with the tribe that be experiences his own apotheosis, besides becoming the husband of the Queen and King of the islands. Lena, after three years of relentless endeavor, discovers his whereabouts, and bursts in unannounced upon his sunny serenity. Aha! Here is his chance to set even, and as she had kept him in hot water at Holland, he does as much for her now: hence, he consigns her to the stewpot. Moral: the worm will turn.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"15 Apr 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"King of the Cannibal Islands","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

A bitter war is waging between two kingdoms, and as the King and Queen hold court in the throne room of the palace there arrives a courier, who, battered and exhausted, has scarcely strength as he falls at the foot of the throne to thrust into the hands of the anxious King, a message which tells of the disaster and panic that has befallen his forces. The King immediately holds council of war and calls for a trusty messenger to carry to his armies the reassuring intelligence that reinforcements have been rushed to their aid. The lot falls to a brave young courier, lion-hearted and with nerve of steel, who, before setting off, goes to take leave of his sweetheart. He discovers her resenting the unwelcomed advances of his rival, a contemptible scoundrel. The villain departs, swearing vengeance, and shadows the hero as he rides off. The sweetheart, on horseback follows to warn her lover of his danger. Now the villain, with the aid of his mistress, who has arranged a meeting by letter, dupes the hero by lying in the road, pretending she is wounded. The hero dismounts to assist her, and is stabbed in the back by the villain, who had hidden in the bush. He secures the message and they make for a neighboring inn, leaving the hero lying in the road, where he is found later by his sweetheart and her attendants. The lover is cared for by his sweetheart and some kindly farm folk, and the attendants are hastened to bring guards. The letter to the villain is found in the road, which indicates his whereabouts, and they repair to the inn where the villain is surprised and arrested. Recovering the message, the hero hastens on to the army. With renewed vigor the opposing forces are repelled and the day won. The last scene shows the return of the gallant courier with this cheering news. He is knighted by the King, and formally betrothed to his faithful sweetheart.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"29 Apr 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The King's Messenger","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

At the parish church the worshipers are observed leaving, among them Magistrate Lorenz. Father Herman and Madalene, a charming young girl whom Lorenz has chosen as the wife of his son Rudolph. They proceed to the home of Lorenz, where Rudolph is observed seated on a bench, meditating. The young man is upbraided by the father for his failure to attend religious services, and while in conversation Leah appears, closely followed by the angry mob. The crowd makes a rush toward her, the priest raises the cross before them and they cower in fear. Beneath a large cross in the forest, Leah is waiting expectantly. Rudolph appears and the lovers, for such they are, rush into each other's arms. The young man asks Leah to marry him and leave home. She promises, and after vowing eternal fidelity the lovers part, agreeing to meet the following day at the same place and from there leave for other parts. Nathan, an apostate Jew, has stolen in behind the pair during their conversation, hears all and gleefully departs unnoticed. He proceeds directly to the home of the magistrate and tells of Rudolph's love for the Jewess. Lorenz is furious, will not believe the tale, and bids Nathan begone. At this time Rudolph appears, and being asked for the truth, haughtily admits his love for Leah. The old magistrate is heartbroken, and he and Nathan decide to buy off Leah with gold. Although indignant, Rudolph consents to have her love tested. Nathan leaves with the large purse of gold and shortly comes upon her. He offers her the purse which she angrily throws to the ground and indignantly leaves him. Nathan stands for the moment perplexed, then puts the gold in his own pocket, takes the empty purse, returns in the house, and shows the purse minus the gold. The father and his associates are overjoyed, while Rudolph is heartbroken. The next day at the appointed time Leah goes to the forest and waits anxiously for Rudolph. As time passes on and he does not appear, she falls to the ground in bitter grief at his supposed unfaithfulness. At his home Rudolph is heartbroken over what he thinks her falsity. He goes inside warily with his father, and presently Leah approaches the house, knocks at the door and begs to speak to Rudolph. The father orders her away. Rudolph appears in the doorway, starts upon seeing Leah, and angrily bids her depart. Leah does not understand his changed manner and pleads with him. Rudolph denounces her, then passes inside, leaving the Jewess in agony on the steps. Preparations for the marriage of Madalene to Rudolph are quickly made and they repair to the church for the ceremony. Leah creeps up to the door and hides as the party enters. She watches the ceremony, and as the villagers leave the church, falls in a faint. Again at the cross in the forest Rudolph is as Leah appears before him. She upbraids him for his faithlessness, while he shows the empty purse and accuses her. She at last comprehends the situation and indignantly denies having taken the money. Rudolph also sees the mistake, falls to his knees and asks for pardon. Leah haughtily turns away, tells of her suffering, and, bitterly abusing him, departs. Five years elapse, and outside Rudolph's home he and Madalene and their little child are seated. Leah comes upon the little girl and kisses the child lovingly. The villagers come upon the pair and jeer at the Jewess. The noise brings Rudolph and Madalene from the house, and Leah points to Nathan, the leader of the mob, denounces him as an apostate Jew, a thief and the instigator of her unhappiness. Rudolph shows the empty purse, justifying the charge. Nathan is taken in hand by officers and dragged away. Leah staggers, then falls dead at Rudolph's feet.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Van Dyke Brooke","Released":"10 Oct 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Leah the Forsaken","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Ritter von Mosenthal (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Dillon, Anthony O'Sullivan","Plot":"Lonesome Junction, though a howling wilderness, possessed one blessing, a train to somewhere else, but like all good things in this world, none are gained without a struggle. So the trains, of which there was but one a day, are never on time. To the station there comes a coterie of weary travelers, all possessed with a wild desire to put a long distance between Lonesome Junction and the backs of their necks. As usual, the train is six hours late, and you may imagine the party is in not a very amiable humor. The first to arrive is an Englishman, who is \"jolly well\" vexed at the condition of affairs. \"Train six hours late! Hit's a blooming h'outrage, don't you know!\" He leaves his suit case in the sway of others coming in, and a wealthy mine owner, who enters at that moment, falls sprawling. The next to enter is a prize-fighter, who in turn takes a tumble. Wow! It looks as if there is going to be \"something doing,\" when the driver of the Pony Express enters with the mail bag, and tells Mr. Pug to sit down and behave. He sits and lights his pipe, still chewing the rag. The driver clips the pipe out of his mouth with a pistol shot and makes him dance to the music of his gun play. This holds Mr. Pug for an indefinite period. The party is now increased by the arrival of Heinrich Spitzelperger. \"Vas ist das; sex stunden zu warten ? Oh, vell, I haf a smoke.\" Heine has pipe and tobacco, but no match. \"Please, you haf a match, no?\" Well, it looks as if he don't smoke. At this point the door opens and in rushes one of those hypochondriacal phisanthropists, a Black Hand Dago. A hyena is a playful kitten compared with him. Opening his satchel, he takes out a large bomb, lights the fuse and places it on the window shelf of the ticket office. The pugilist is the first to notice his action and yells, \"Beat it!\" which they surely do, all except Heine, who is seated on a bench still searching through his pockets in hopes of finding a match hidden therein. Espying the smoking fuse of the bomb, he picks it up, ignorant of the danger, lights his pipe and failing to extinguish it, drops it into a fire pail none too soon, for the moment it strikes the water it explodes, blowing Heine off his feet. When the party returns they find him suffering no further injury than badly shattered nerves. While relating his experience there enters a most beautiful young lady. \"Observe who is in our midst,\" says one, and a more chivalrous bunch you never saw; all anxious to serve her. She states that her baggage is outside, so Mr. Pug insists that \"I'm de boy wit de strong arm.\" He carries in several grips and finally a trunk as big as a cottage, which completely does him up, and though there is still another trunk, he is not equal to it. Now Heine gives an exhibition of brain vs. brawn, and instead of shouldering the trunk, wheels it in on a hand truck, much to the amusement of the party at the expense of the pugilist. They are all now in high spirits when there appears in the doorway a tough road agent With most forbidding mien he points a revolver and commands them to line up and put their valuables on the floor in front of him. Heine, unobserved by the bad man, drops down behind the trunk and when the thug's back is turned, sticks a gun behind his ear and tells him to drop his firearm on the top of the trunk. Hurrah for Heine, the hero! But he forgets the thug may have another gun, and in the unguarded moment he whips out another and is about to push daylight through Dutchy when the express driver from outside sends a bullet through the bad boy's wrist. The arrival of the belated train is announced, and the party scramble out of the station, in a mad rush to get aboard.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"22 Jan 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Lonesome Junction","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Edward Dillon (scenario), Anthony O'Sullivan (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Of the thousands who daily witness moving picture exhibitions, the number who have any conception of the manner of making a picture is comparatively small. Therefore, to the majority this picture will prove a genuine novelty. It opens in the private office of the Vitagraph Company, where the manuscript is being carefully considered. The studio directors enter, receive their instructions, proceed to the studio, get out the cameras, give orders about scenery, props, etc. Then we get a view of the Vitagraph actors and actresses making up for their different characters. All preparations finished, the Vitagraph automobiles line up. The performers get in and proceed to the scene of operation, which happens to be, in this instance, a busy city thoroughfare. A trolley is held up, numerous little by-plays, not in the lines, occur to add variety and interest to the picture. This scene over, all hands return to the studio, where we see a stupid actor being put through his work. Next a view is given of the quick lunch counter in the Vitagraph plant. Following this, the studio scenes are rehearsed and photographed, showing all the necessary paraphernalia for the different effects required, as well as the rapidity with which scenes are struck and made ready by the stage hands. The picture finally finished is taken to the testing room, where we see it projected. The Story: \"Love Is Better than Riches.\" A young soldier and his sweetheart are sitting in the parlor of the girl's home. The young man proposes and is accepted. The young lady's father enters, is furious when he hears of the engagement, and orders the young man out of the house. He goes, taking his sweetheart with him. They hurry to a church, are married and return to her home. The couple tells the father of their marriage. The old man is beside himself with rage and turns them out into the street. Their start in life is humble, but their home is happy, while that of the father is lonely. The next scene shows the girl and her soldier husband walking along the street. The young man leaves his wife for a moment, when an automobile dashes along, knocking her down. The auto is owned by her father. The old man gets out, recognizes his daughter and wants to take charge of her when the husband appears, waves him aside and takes his wife to their home. We find the young man waiting upon the invalid when the father enters and begs forgiveness. A happy reconciliation takes place and the picture closes with the father fondly embracing his daughter.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Documentary, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"J.

John is a clergyman and a noble, upright fellow, while Tom is a scapegrace, wild, reckless and unscrupulous. Not having the parental guidance so essential in youth, his father being dead and his mother blind, he drifted into bad company, the contaminating influence deeply affecting his susceptible nature. Despite the earnest pleading of his brother John he sank lower in morass of transgression, spending most of his time at the ale house drinking and at cards. All this John has succeeded in keeping from his dear mother, whose blindness is almost a blessing, for a mother would rather her eyes be sightless than to view the indiscretions of her loved ones. So she possessed the blissful impression that her boys were both paragons of righteousness. God's mercy is unfailing; you will admit this Divine Charity. In the village there dwelt, as neighbors to Wilkins, Farmer Tobias and his wife, and their daughter, Gladys. Tom and Gladys grew up together, and were child sweethearts, which grew stronger with Gladys as time went on. So deeply did she love the handsome Tom that she put her entire trust in him, feeling sure that he would reciprocate her sacrificial devotion with the honorable obligation it merited. But, oh, how mistaken she was, and only after prayers and tearful entreaties does he agree to marry her, and then only upon condition that she elope. To this she consents most reluctantly, for which act she is disowned by her parents. The villainy that is wrapped up in the black heart of Tom. Truly a marriage ceremony is performed, but it is by a rowdy friend of Tom's, disguised as a clergyman, in fact, a mock marriage. For a time Gladys lived in ignorance of the truth, but it at last came out when Tom deserts her. Back to her home she trudged carrying her infant, and at the door she is met by her mother with open arms but when the father appears, he, still obdurate, drives her away. She then goes to John Wilkins, and tells her sad story. He calls Tom and demands he make immediate reparation. Tom treats the matter lightly and the brothers are on the verge of blows when the blind mother, like a ministering angel, appears, and Tom's heart is at last softened. He takes Gladys and their child to his bosom, while they receive the benediction bestowed by their priestly brother.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

This became more torturing as time went on, until at last, when the bank was arranging to ship a large quantity of cash to the West to relieve the recent money stringency, he made up his mind to heed the solicitude of that specter which had haunted him. Listening to the instructions given to the bank's messenger as to the shipment of the funds, he hustles off to a gang of crooks in whose company he had fallen. He tells of the proposed shipment, what express, what time and where to. They are not long in devising a plan, and a most clever one at that. A large coffin box is procured and one of the parties is to be fastened in it in such a way that he can release himself at the proper time. This is to be shipped on the same train and to the same place as the funds, the others of the gang to go as passengers. Next a man is selected to go into the box. This is done by drawing from a pack of cards; the one getting the Ace of Spades is elected. By fatal fortuity it falls to the bank clerk. In he goes and is shipped off. The coffin box and the express strong box containing the funds are now seen reposing in the express room of a lonely Western station. It is past midnight and the last train has gone through. The station agent, making himself secure for the night, so he thinks, starts to eat his lunch in the next room. Slowly and noiselessly the top of the coffin box raises and out comes the man. With pistol in hand, he stealthily approaches the agent from behind. His first intention is to shoot, but, no, this would arouse the village. A blow on the head with the butt of the gun brings the agent to the door like a log. The door is locked. From the agent's pocket he gets the key, opens the door and signals to the crooks who are in waiting. They enter and at once start to break open the box by drilling and blasting the cover. Meanwhile, the agent, who was only stunned by the blow, crawls to his telegraph instrument and sends out a help signal. A terrific explosion and the iron box is opened, but, as they are taking out the coveted cash, they are surprised by the arrival of the railroad men, overpowered and taken into custody.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Crime, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"19 Jun 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Man in the Box","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Sunday night is a most busy one for the coppers, and the cooler on Monday morning is jammed with a fascinated mob of law breakers. Quiet reigns as we enter the Hall of Justice, for Bobby, the page, is in the land of nod, while Clarence the cop, who is addicted to the habit of smoking cigarettes in his sleep, is snoring that beautiful sonata. \"Please go away and let me sleep.\" Regina, the scrubwoman, arouses them, and Bobby, with the bell, opens court. The first to arrive are Mr. Ignatius O'Brien and Mr. Diogenes Cassidy, the attorneys. The gentlemen are bosom friends and get along together like monkey and parrot. Then, ta-ta-ta-tah! The Hon. Patrick Henry McPheeney enters. He is awfully brutal to Clarence, and snatches the cigarette from his mouth, hurling, yes hurling it to the floor, curse him! The Judge has a large gavel with which he calls the court to order; also using it upon occasions on the heads of the learned attorneys, when they become too demonstrative. The first prisoner to be tried is Happy Hooligan. He is sent up so high it makes him dizzy; next comes Serpentine Sue, the snake charmer, arrested for exercising her subtle contortions on a frankfurter in lieu of the delinquent basket. She is sentenced for life, and should she make it out, is to be hanged. Two small boys are then brought in, charged with having shot the chutes. Diogenes' plea in their behalf brings forth such a flood of tears that the urchins float out on the tide. \"O! Look who's in our midst.\" Flossie, the pride of the boardwalk, has been so indiscreet as to wear a sheath-gown and an overzealous cop pinches her: but it is easy for Floss, as his Honor's hitherto flinty heart melts like an ice cream block perched on the equator, and he himself escorts her to her auto. Scrappy Rosenberg and Izzy McManus are next hauled in for prize fighting, so are allowed to give a sample of their talents. A spirited bout now takes place, which concludes with the pugs knocking out everyone in the court and then beating it.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

We first find him begging on the. street, a young girl passes and drops her purse, which the miser picks up. When she returns to regain it he knocks her insensible and makes off. Finding a generous roll of notes in the purse, he goes to the bank to have them exchanged for gold coin. A couple of thugs witness the transaction and are at once infected by the money fever.

She is sent from the room and they divide the spoils. While the division is equal, each is invidious of the other's share. They retire, both possessed of the same thought, one waiting for the other to fall asleep. One lies with a pistol in hand; the other with a dagger. At length one gets up to stab the other, but receives a bullet in his breast. With a mighty effort he plunges the dagger into the heart of his adversary and both fall over dead. The shot brings in the old hag, who, finding them both dead, seizes their loot and in a frenzy pours it out upon the table. In doing so she knocks the lighted candle to the floor, which ignites the litter of straw and rubbish and the place is soon in flames, incinerating the three.

Herr Von Mitzel, a disciple of Antonio Stradivari, fell deeply in love with his pupil, the daughter of a wealthy English lord. His love was returned by the fair young maid, who grieved at the disparity of their rank, and wished that he had been more highly born or she more lowly. Oh, the tyranny of fate! What discouraging conditions were brought to bear upon their affections; but true love can no more be diminished by showers of evil-hap than flowers are marred by timely rains; so the conspiring circumstances tended rather to strengthen than to weaken their passion. Now, in the Winter of his existence, we find Von Mitzel alone and forlorn. His only companion and solace is his faithful violin, the strains of which are more eloquent than melodious, conjuring up as they do the recollections of life's Spring-time. We picture him seated at his cheerless fireside, playing his, or rather her favorite selection, and as the sweet tones float out upon the silent night, there appears on the wall a phantasmagorical portrayal of his thoughts, which bring him back to days of yore. The image of his inamorata is first seen; then the lesson on the harpsichord, when he declares his love; next the scene of her being forced by her parents into an odious marriage compact; then a duel with his rival, in which he is wounded. The scene dissolves into the reappearance of the girl. The subject is most beautiful and touching and is sure to win the sympathetic approval of the spectator, besides being a work of photographic excellence.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"06 May 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Music Master","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"D.W.

Hence it was that the mere mention of his name sent terror to the hearts of the stage drivers of the mountains. Many were the wonderful tales told at the relay inns along the stage route that made the tourists shudder with fear as they resumed their course westward. Dick Stanley was one of the nerviest drivers on the stage line and had, as yet, escaped molestation from Jack, Dick was deeply in love with Mollie, the innkeeper's daughter, but, as our story opens, they quarrel and fall out. At this moment along rides Jack, who, of course, is unknown to Mollie. He asks for a drink from the well beside which the girl stands. The bright, cheerful countenance of Mollie makes a decided impression upon Jack, and it is needless to say that the handsome young bandit, well, it is a case of love at first sight. Jack drives off, and Dick, who has watched the proceedings from a distance, approaches to acquaint her of Jack's real being. She takes no heed of Dick, but is still gazing fondly at the fast fading vision of Jack so Dick mounts his stage box and is off. The stage arrives at a lonesome turn in the road when Jack jumps from the brush and, covering Dick with his gun, orders him to dismount, the passengers to get out and give up their valuables, placing them in a handkerchief, which he makes Dick spread on the ground. Having trimmed them, he orders them back into the coach and Dick to drive off. Then he gathers up and makes off with the booty. Dick drives around back to the inn, gives the alarm, and a posse of mounted cowboys start out after the outlaw. Jack, driven by the pursuing party to the top of a precipitous cliff, deserting his horse, climbs, or rather tumbles, down over the rocks, badly cutting and bruising himself as he goes. Reaching the bottom, he runs through the woods and comes upon Mollie who hides him in the well just in time to elude the pursuers who drive up. She sends them off in the wrong direction, and, when they have gone, assists Jack out of the well, binds up his wounded head with a strip of linen torn from her skirt and gives him her horse, on which he escapes. The cowboys soon find they are on the wrong scent and return just in time to see Jack galloping like mad down the open trail. Here follows a most exciting chase, showing some marvelous horsemanship. Jack has distanced them, but his horse runs lame, and he makes a heroic dash on foot towards a barn. Failing to open the lower doors, he climbs up on a rope to the second story, pulls up the rope and closes the door. The posse now arrives, and a fusillade of bullets is sent at the door, which Jack retaliates, laying out a couple of the party. They at length set fire to the barn, and Jack is forced out through the back, and, as he leaps, a well-directed bullet from Dick's gun sends him reeling to the ground, just as Mollie, who has followed the chase on horseback, dashes up, dismounts and takes Jack's head in her arms only to find him dead.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"23 Jun 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Outlaw","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"D.W.

The waters of the sea have been infested with a band of gold-thirsty pirates, who pillaged every ship that came their way. Having successfully perpetuated one of their nefarious exploits, they are struck by a storm and forced to put out from their floundering vessel in a small yawl, in which they place a chest of valuables, for the shore. Thrown up on the coast by the voluminous waves, they disembark; there are three of them, the chief and two underlings. Taking the chest to a place of safety, they proceed to divide the spoils. A contention arises, and the two turn on their chief, who strikes down one of them at once, but is stabbed in the back by the other, whom he afterwards strangles. Gathering up the treasure, he struggles along, his life's blood oozing from the wound inflicted by the mutinous pirate, until he comes to the cottage of Wilkinson. A terrific storm is still raging and the poor old mother is trying to shut out the force of the gale when the chief staggers in. He begs her to hide the gold, which she does by dislodging several bricks in the fireplace and placing the treasure behind them. This is hardly done when the pirate chief drops dead from the loss of blood and the poor woman is felled by lightning. Hence, the hiding place is seemingly an eternal secret. What a sad home-coming it is for the son, after his success abroad. A year later, however, we find him a happy bridegroom and the sun again shines on the household. But eight years later he is stricken ill, with nothing in store for his wife and little one. The process server has seized the effects, and despondingly he goes to the kitchen to put an end to his unendurable existence. The good wife, suspicious, follows and just as he puts a pistol to his head she strikes his arm, causing the bullet to crash into the fireplace, splintering the bricks and disinterring the hidden treasure.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Action","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The wife wearies of the monotonous grind of farm life and is easy prey of a contemptible villain, in the person of Tom Roland, the ubiquitous \"other man,\" fate ordains it so. The wife's sister is an innocent, good-natured tomboy girl, who never for a moment dreamed that her sister's low spirits were due to anything else than ill-health; no more did John. He tries his best to cheer his wife, and as he bids her and the baby a fond adieu in the morning on his departure for the fields, he begs her to be hopeful, that better conditions are in store. Scarcely has he crossed the threshold when Roland appears at the window. This decides her; so taking her wedding ring from her finger and leaving a note of farewell, she elopes with the serpent. At that moment the sister enters, sees the note and determines to save her at any cost. Donning her riding bloomers, and armed with a revolver, she leaps on a horse and dashes wildly after them, they having escaped in a phaeton. On, on they go at breakneck speed, both holding the distance between them, until the harness breaks on the horse of the elopers and they resort to a rowboat to get across the river. Down comes the sister, and leaping from her horse, dashes to the landing, and with the aid of her gun enlists the services of the old boatman to row in pursuit. Masking her face, that her identity will be unknown, she fires at the fleeing couple, causing them to heave to. Coming abreast, and flourishing the gun, she compels Roland to leap overboard and swim off. Then she commands the wife to board her boat, and at the landing, to return home. Here she makes herself known, and in a struggle the wife gets possession of the gun, when in rushes Roland and seizing the sister is choking her, when kin asserts itself in the wife and she sends a bullet crashing through Roland's arm, who at the point of the gun is driven from the place. The wife, realizing her folly, as John enters throws herself in his arms, he being in total ignorance of her experience and narrow escape. Once more, and for all time, peace reigns in the little home, thanks to Tomboy Nellie.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Action, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Three thousand years ago there dwelt in Egyptian Memphis, the ancient capital of the Pharaohs, a wealthy prince, whose wife in beauty was likened to Athor, the Egyptian Venus, with heart as cold as Egyptian marble. The prince, worried and suspicious, seeks the royal seer, who tells him the princess has a lover, and in a vision shows him the princess in the arms of that lover, a Theban warrior. Instant death is the punishment meted out to the guilty pair. The princess is placed on a bier and carried out in front of the Temple, under the very shadow of the Pyramids of Gizeh. Here the High Priest, with a flambeau, sets fire to the pyre and her body is burned as an offering, with prayers, to mighty Osiris, beseeching that he overcome Typhon, who seems to hold sway. Alongside the pyre is placed a vase, decorated with hieroglyphics, which is to be the sarcophagus of that ethereal of the unfortunate princess. The smoke and vapor, as it arises from the body, enters the vase in a most mysterious manner. The vase is then sealed and the cavalcade proceeds with it to the tomb, where it is deposited and the door of the tomb closed, it was thought forever. Three thousand years later there came to the \"Land of Ruins\" a Boston professor, student of the illustrious Jean Francois Chainpollion, discoverer of the key to Egyptian hieroglyphics who unearthed the vase and took it to his home in Boston. Vague, indeed, was the story he learned about the treasure, and while sitting in his study, cudgeling his brain to lift the veil of mystery from it, falls to sleep, and in this psychological condition imagines the maid, while dusting, knocks the vase from the tabouret on which it stands. Bursting into bits, it emits a dense vapor, from which the reincarnate princess appears. Here is trouble. Our friend, the professor, is a married man, whose better-half is a buxom, unethereal person, who doesn't believe in the \"Soul Sister\" tommyrot. She, of course, wants an explanation, which the nervous professor is unable to give, so he bolts and runs hatless out of the house, followed by the princess, both followed by Mrs. Professor. Into a restaurant he rushes, with the princes at his heels. At the restaurant, as they sit enjoying a repast, the reincarnate Theban lover appears and claims the princess. This the old professor resents and is run through by the Egyptian just as the wife enters. Mortally wounded, he falls to the floor, from the sofa, for the scene changes and we find the professor awakening from a horrible dream, the pain of the sword thrust being induced by a severe attack of indigestion.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"27 Feb 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Princess in the Vase","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

One seems to have had things her own way for a time, having been cast always for the leading roles, which opportunities made her the \"public's pet.\" However, she does not wear the mantle of fame becomingly, for her success has made her petulant, peevish and selfish. On the other hand, her rival works studiously, and by her subtle art has won some attention, until during a performance of \"Darkest Russia\" she completely eclipses the histrionic luster of the hitherto favorite. In the Ballroom Scene (which is one of the most novel and pretentious ever staged in motion pictures) she simply carries all before her, eliciting thunderous applause and bravos of an enthusiastic audience, and the admiration of the pariahs and hoi pollois of the company. The curtain is raised again and again on the scene of her triumph, until she is called forward and a shower of floral tributes bestowed upon her. As may be imagined, this is viewed with cringing odium by her rival, who proceeds to the dressing-room, convulsed with rage, where the maid does her best to soothe her. At this moment the new star enters; her beautiful visage more radiant than the resplendent flowers with which she is laden. The offering of some of the blossoms to her companion, who has endeavored to suppress her passion, is the precursor of a stormy scene. The rage of jealousy fires her soul, and the recrudescent dethroned queen pounces upon the invidious bouquets, tearing them to shreds. What follows must be left to your imagination in this description, as it is simply indescribable, and must be seen to be appreciated. Enough it is to say the two women struggle and fight furiously until the stage manager, whom the maid has called, separates them with his time-worn injunction, \"Be a l-a-d-y!\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"04 Jan 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Professional Jealousy","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The husband seemed content in the struggle, working at the factory for the pittance he received, but his love for his wife made the labor light. On the other hand, to the young wife this condition was most odious. In the grind of household duties, having, from force of circumstances, to do them all unassisted, she was like a flower withering for want of sunshine. Hence it was not surprising that she listened avidiously to the flattering platitudes of the unconscionable tempter. In the first scene we see her at the ironing table, while her husband bids her a tender adieu on his departure for work. Hardly has he left the threshold, when the grocer's clerk enters, and is received with an effusiveness most unplatonic. They at once proceed to enjoy a little lunch, the ingredients of which the clerk has brought in a basket. Meanwhile the husband arrives at the factory, only to find it closed down. Retracing his steps he arrives home, and seeing the window down and the shade closed, his suspicions are aroused. Stealthily raising the window and lifting the shade slightly, his fears are confirmed. His action, quiet though it be, startles the lovers, who leave the lunch table and hide behind a sheet hanging across the room. Entering, the husband, with gaze riveted on the sheet, picks up a pistol and sits himself in front of their hiding place, calmly lights his pipe and waits. At length he beckons, \"Come out.\" (This is undoubtedly the most tense situation ever attempted in motion pictures.) The clerk appears first, followed by wife, and the reckoning is paid.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Having just returned from the appraiser's office, and it being late, she puts up at the hotel for the night. In the office at Kate's arrival there is a Mexican woman who has just lost her money at Faro. At sight of Kate's gold she becomes desperate and at once plans to secure it. Kate is shown to a room, and is soon asleep with the bag of yellow nuggets reposing under her pillow. Suddenly the face of the Mexican woman is seen at the window, and she has little trouble in forcing it open. Her intrusion awakens Kate, but she overpowers her and gains the gold in the struggle. Kate manages to fire her revolver, with a view to bring aid, but all too late, for the thief makes good her escape, leaving behind on the door an incriminating mantilla, which discovers the identity of the culprit. A chase is made after the fugitive, the hotel clerk, friend of Kate's, leading the way. This poor fellow, however, is dropped in his tracks by a bullet from the woman's gun in ambush. Distancing her pursuers, the Mexican woman comes upon an Indian girl, who, with her half-breed husband, are camped alongside the river. The Red Girl bides the Mexican woman and throws the searching posse on the wrong trail. In return for the kindly act on the part of the Red Girl, the Mexican woman plies her wiles on the half-breed husband, not only taking him away, but inducing him to kill his wife. To this end they plan a torture. Binding her hands and feet, they take her to a large trunk of a dead tree, which overhangs the river, and here they hang her, like Tantalus, suspended between water and sky. With her teeth she manages to free one of her hands and with an ornament on her necklace contrives to saw the rope and drop into the water. Swimming to the shore she again meets Kate and her friends, and volunteers to become their guide in running down the miscreants, who have embarked in a canoe and are rapidly paddling down the river. Into another canoe the pursuers leap and are soon shortening the distance between themselves and the scoundrels, until at length they come up with them, and a hand-to-hand conflict ensues, during which both canoes are capsized, and a terrific struggle in the water ends with the overpowering of the pair and arrest of the Mexican Jezebel. The dip in the river has evidently chilled the half-breed's ardor for the Mexican woman, for he tries to return to the Red Girl, but she repulses him, and we leave her and Kate standing on the cliff, enfolded in each other's arms, bathed in the golden rays of a setting sun. Indeed a most beautiful scene.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

He eked his existence by fishing, hunting and mining, having a small claim which he clandestinely worked, hiding his gains in the trunk of an old tree. It is needless to say that he was beloved by those few who knew him, among whom was a little boy, who was his almost constant companion. One day he took the little fellow to his deposit vault, the tree trunk, and showed him the yellow nuggets he had dug from the earth, presenting him with a couple of them. In the camp there were a couple of low-down human coyotes, who would rather steal than work. They had long been anxious to find the hiding place of the Indian's wealth, so capture the boy, and by beating and torture compel him to disclose its whereabouts. In the meantime there has come to the place a couple of surveyors who enlist the services of the Indian to guide them to the hilltop. Here they arrive, set up their telescope and start calculations. An idea strikes them to allow the Indian to look through the 'scope. He is amazed at the view, so close does it bring the surrounding country to him. While his eye is at the glass one of the surveyors slowly turns it on the revolving head until the Indian starts back with an expression of horror, then looks again, and with a cry of anguish dashes madly away down the mountain side, for the view was enough to freeze the blood in his veins. Arriving at the old tree trunk, his view through the telescope is verified, for there is the result he improvised bank rifled, and the old grandfather of the little boy, who had followed the miscreants murdered. Picking the old man up he carries his lifeless form back to the camp, reaching there just after the murderers, with the boy, had decamped in a canoe. Laying the body on the sands and covering it tenderly with his shawl he stands over it and solemnly vows to be avenged. What a magnificent picture he strikes as he stands there, his tawny skin silhouetted against the sky, with muscles turgid and jaws set in grim determination. It is but for a moment he stands thus, yet the pose speaks volumes. Turning quickly, he leaps into a canoe at the bank and paddles swiftly after the fugitives. On, on goes the chase, the Indian gaining steadily on them, until at last abandoning hope, they leave their canoe and try to wade to shore as the Indian comes up. Leaping from his boat he makes for the pair, seizing one as the other swims to the opposite shore. Clutching him by the throat the Indian forces his head beneath the surface of the water and holds it there until life is extinct, after which he dashes in pursuit of the other. This proves to be a most exciting swimming race for a life. They reach the other shore almost simultaneously, and a ferocious conflict takes place on the sands terminating in the Indian forcing his adversary to slay himself with his own dagger. Having now fulfilled his vow he leaps into the water and swims back to the canoe in which sits the terrified boy, and as night falls he paddles slowly back to camp.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Western, Short, Action","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Realizing her end near, Mrs. Simonson takes from her neck a chain and locket and places it around the neck of her daughter, Ruth, with the prayerful injunction that she be ever guided in the path of prudence and virtue by this memorial. Commending her to the care of her father, the old lady goes to meet her Master in the Great Beyond. Two years later we find Ruth assisting her old father in his pawnshop. Mr. Simonson, although a money-lender, is benevolent in nature and his many deeds of munificence have endeared him to all who know him. Hence, when the local schatchen appears with Jacob Rubenstein, a wealthy suitor for his daughter's hand, it was his desire for her future happiness that induced him to look with favor on him. Ruth, however, had given her heart to Sol Bimberg, an impecunious bookseller in the neighborhood. While Mr. Simonson has no aversion for Sol, still to wed his daughter is out of the question, as his prospects are very poor. Ruth is determined, and when it comes to choosing between her father and her lover, she accepts the latter. Seven years later the little family, increased by a child, are living happily, when a fall from a ladder causes the death of Sol. Ruth, finding business cares too much for her, is forced to sell out to Rubenstein. The pittance realized from the sale does not last long, and poor Ruth is stricken down with the dread disease that carried off her mother. Reduced to poverty, she is forced to send the little girl to the pawnshop with the locket, on which to raise enough to buy a bit of bread. At the pawnshop, old Simonson recognizes the locket, and his heart at once softens, so he goes with the child to the garret, where he arrives just in time to reconcile his lost one when she breathes her last. Crushed and heartbroken, the old man folds her child, his granddaughter, to his breast, which forms the closing scene of a most touching and heart-stirring film. Several of the scenes arc decidedly interesting in the fact that they were actually taken in the thickly settled Hebrew quarters of New York City.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

While our friend Benj. Bibbs was not exactly parsimonious still there were times when he kicked most vigorously against his wife's extravagance. Such an occasion opens our story. Milady Bibbs has just had sent home a hat and gown, for which poor Bibbsy has to give up, but when he sees her attired in the duds, he softens, for she certainly does look stunning. All is well until she turns around when, O, horror! It is a sheath gown of a most pronounced type. \"You brazen hussy, to appear such!\" He could say no more, for he fairly choked with rage, and rushes from the room in a state of turbulent perturbation; but not until he has ruthlessly thrown a floor rug over his shameless wife. The maid of the family is in league with a crook, and the pair have plotted to rob the place. To this end the crook has written a note to the maid, telling her to signal when the coast is clear. This note falls into the hands of Bibbs, and as it is simply addressed \"Honey\" and signed \"Lovingly, Tom,\" his jealous nature at once associates it with his wife. \"Aha! Sheath gown, honey, signal from the window, meet in drawing room, lovingly, Tom. I see it all: You would deceive me, eh? We shall see!\" Into the fireplace and up the chimney he goes to hide, intent upon trapping his apparently perfidious spouse and her paramour. He is hardly ensconced when the maid, on order of the madam, builds a fire on the hearth, and yon may imagine Bibbs' position is not a pleasant one. To descend is out of the question, and as he ascends he dislodges the soot which covers him from head to foot. The noise induced by his scrambling amid smoke and soot alarms the women folks and several policemen answer their cries, who capture \"Lovingly, Tom\" 'neatb the rose tree in the garden. The women insist that the real offender is still in the flue, and a mad rush to the roof brings the coppers there just as poor soot-begrimed Bibbs emerges from the chimney. Chased over the roofs, he in desperation leaps off, coming down on the heads of a couple of Willie boys who are gossiping alongside a mortar box. Into the cement tumble the trio, and a sorry sight they present when the police and others arrive. Explanations prove what a colossal fool Bibbs has been, but still it served him right, and his discomfort is the spectators' sport, for the subject is a most hilariously humorous one, with a scream in every foot of length.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Such is the time of action of the Biograph's latest comedy. Tis afternoon and outside the little old schoolhouse a furious blizzard rages. The earth has donned her spotless robe of white and the landscape presents a brilliant spectacle, but pitiless Boreas lashes in whirling directions the fleecy snow, heaping it up into miniature mountain ranges. School session concluding, the youngsters come tumbling out into the snow. Romping about, snowballing and like sports are indulged in, until finally they set to work to build a snowman. Around it they dance in high glee, and at length the little revelers depart reluctantly for home, leaving the snowman in abject loneliness. \"The day has fled, and dismal night descends, casting her sable arms around the world and folding all within her sable grasp.\" Then the moon, fair regent of the night, rises ghost-like from the dim horizon, shedding her silvery light across the frozen moor, and seems to mock the cheerless solitude of the icy sentinel, until the good Fairy of the Snows appears and with her mystic want imbues him with life. At this moment along comes Predatory Pete, returning from one of his nocturnal expeditions. He has just clandestinely reduced the census of a neighboring henhouse by four fat pullets, which he has in a bag slung over his shoulder. Coming suddenly upon the snow-man, he is at first startled, but soon discovers what it is, and putting his pipe in the snowman's mouth, takes out a bottle to toast his frozen majesty, when, to his amazement, the snow-man is seen puffing away on the pipe with apparent enjoyment. Aghast, he drops the bottle and chickens and dashes madly across the fields, frightened almost as white as the snow through which he flounders. The snow-man picks up the bottle and takes a swig. \"Nectar! What joy is here?\" and he drains the bottle. Here is an oddity, a snow-man with a jag. Staggering into the schoolhouse, he finds the temperature too high, so throws the stove out into snow-drifts. Overcome by the booze, he lays down in the snow to sleep it off. Early morning finds him still asleep as the school children are returning to their lessons. All have entered but Sallie Simpkins, the village romp. At Sallie's approach Mr. Snow-man awakes and frightens her almost into convulsions. She darts into the schoolhouse and convinces the teacher and scholars that the place is bewitched. Out they come, and, guided by Pete, the coon, follow the vacillating roving snow-man circumambulating over the frigid, fleecy kopjes back to the point of starting, and find him standing on the very spot where he came into being. Cautiously they approach, and, led by the coon, make a mad rush on Mr. Snowman, who from the assault crumbles and falls into a heap of \"Oh, Slush!\" The subject of this film must appeal to you as being screamingly funny, while the scenic beauty is indeed incomparable and novel.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"19 Feb 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Snowman","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Such was the power of pretty Roulette Sue, the belle of the mining camp. Phil Bowen and Sam Lewis were a couple of fearless road agents, and our story starts with them waylaying the overland stage coach, commanding the driver and his passengers to alight and \"shell out.\" The passengers comprise a Chinaman, a tenderfoot and Roulette Sue. The tenderfoot is frightened out of his wits, while the Chink trembles so as to almost dislocate his queue, but Sue stands and views the episode with an indifferent air, while Sam covers the little coterie with his guns Phil divests them of their valuables. Sue has a brace of pistols in her belt which Phil takes, extracting the cartridges, hands them back to her empty and harmless. Her defiant mien makes a decided impression on him, as, on the other hand, he has, by his easy, gallant manner, impressed her; besides, a part of his features, which are unconcealed by the mask, gives promise that he is a handsome fellow. Well, it is surely a case of love at first sight. The deed done, Phil orders the coach to proceed on its way, while he and Sam go to their shack to divide the spoils. The coach, arriving at the camp, an alarm is given. and a party of miners start out for the bandits. Sue, who is in deepest sympathy with the handsome young outlaw, starts off at the same time, and, by a short cut, arrives at the shack and warns Phil and Sam of their impending danger. Sam, who has also shown a weakness for Sue, tries to kiss her, but is not only repulsed by her, but knocked down by Phil for the insult. Thus does she transform two staunch friends into bitter enemies. Still, there is no time to parley, as their necks are in danger, so they do a quick get-away. Several days later Sam appears at the tavern and renews his attentions to Sue. Again Phil, who enters at that moment, protects her, and Sam through jealousy denounces him before the crowd. Guns are drawn, and it looked for an instant as if Phil would be punctured in many places, but quick as a flash, he picks up a child from the road, holds it up in front of him, backs off out of harm's way and makes good his escape. Sam now figures the coast is clear and awaits his opportunity. But love knows no danger, has no fear, and hence. Phil returns to see Sue, although it is most hazardous. Phil and Sue are alone in the tavern when the approach of someone forces him to hide behind a curtain. It is Sam who enters and, with violent persistence, forces his odious attentions upon Sue. Things are becoming alarming, when a shot from behind the curtain lays Sam out. Sam, thinking the shot came from Sue's gun, raises himself on his elbow and sends a leaden dart through her which closes the blinds of her mortal existence forever. He is recognized, gives himself up for the usual punishment meted out for those of his kind.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"10 Jul 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Stage Rustler","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Cumpson","Plot":"It would have taken more than the wonderful powers of deduction of a Sherlock Holmes to have dispelled the mystery that shrouded the disappearance of a case of jewels at the home of Robert Jenkins, a wealthy stockbroker, and although they were eventually brought to light, it was through a most remarkable accident. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins are getting ready for an evening at the opera, and. as usual Mrs. Jenkins is tantalizingly slow in her preparations, and is almost carried out of the house by the impatient Jenkins. Baby Jenkins is very much in evidence, and requires a bribe to induce her to remain contented with the maid. This Mrs. J. furnishes in the shape of a papier-maché doggie, the head of which is removed to find its interior filled with candy. Mrs. Jenkins is inclined to deck herself out in her diamonds, and takes the case from the strong-box, but in her anxiety to appease her husband's flustering, she hurriedly kisses baby and departs, forgetting all about the jewels. They are not long in the theater before the thought of the diamonds comes to her, and the awful possible result of her carelessness. She will not rest until Mr. Jenkins takes her home. On arriving there, sure enough her worst fears are apparently confirmed. There on the desk lies the jewel case empty. Good heavens! what's to be done? No one was in the house but the baby and nurse, both of whom are now abed. There is no trace or sign of the entrance of a thief. How did it happen? Well, the detectives are summoned and put to work on the case, but without success, although a reward of $10,000 is offered for the apprehension of the robbers and return of the jewels. The detectives finally give the matter up. Poor Jenkins is certainly up against it, for the loss of the jewels is the beginning of a streak of wretched luck. He is beaten on all sides in the stock market until at length he is forced to the wall. Poverty, disgrace and even starvation stare him and his loved ones in the face. Forced to sell his house and then the furniture to satisfy his creditors, he is in the depths of despair as he stands and views his precious little one playing on the floor with her doggie, unconscious of the anguish of her father. Piece by piece the household effects are seized, until there remains but a couple of chairs, on one of which Baby places her doggie. At that moment the door opens and Smithson, Jenkins' friend, enters to offer his sympathy and aid. Smithson is a good hearted, blustering fellow, and in the enthusiasm of his friendship, flusters about, finally throwing himself into the only chair in the room, not noticing the toy, of course crushing it to atoms. Leaping to his feet, he is profuse in apologies, when, lo and behold! there among the fragments of the broken dog lay the diamonds. The clouds that hung over the household are dissipated and the little family may start anew. There are many sensational incidents in the course of the film, one showing the curb market of New York is most unique.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Servitors stand awaiting the arrival of their master, who, appearing on the scene, throws his cloak to an attendant; unbuckling his sword, he hands him that also, then at the word of command the attendant throws them upward and they vanish. The knight then takes two large rings, a sheet of paper, which he places on one of the rings, then fitting the other over the paper draws it taut as a drum. Two attendants then hold the paper-covered rings upright, another hands a paint brush and paint to the knight, who proceeds to draw a face on the paper. This at a sign changes into a laughing, roguish character. The knight then plunges his arms through the eyes of the figure and draws therefrom bottles of wine which he hands to an attendant who surreptitiously drinks their contents. Making an incision where the mouth is drawn, our knight takes therefrom shawls, scarves and wraps of the finest texture. Taking the rings from the attendants, he turns it about to show there is nothing further therein, he hands it back and again draws this time four magnificent ladies' costumes, which he hands to his helper, He now takes the rings from the two pages and rolling them off the scene stands the boys in center of the hall, fuming them round he produces two other pages from them, then throwing the costumes to the four, who donning them are changed into four ladies who go through a graceful dance. Taking off the dresses, they change again to pages; the four become two and vanish from view. The knight takes a ring, ties four ropes to it, and, suspending it in mid-air, calls a page, who sits under it. Then from the ring there gradually ascends a fairy form, who at a sign again descends. The knight next causes a pedestal to appear, standing thereon he holds aloft one of the rings, which gradually lowers itself on the knight who disappears; appearing from another side, he takes the two rings, placing them edge to edge they form a cycle, which the knight mounts and rides away.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Georges Méliès","Released":"18 Jan 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"6 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Knight of Black Art","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

She was indeed the fairest flower that e'er blossomed in the land of the golden sun. At this tavern there stopped the honest, hardy miners and trappers of the neighboring country on their way to and from their claims in the mountains. A sort of a rest-up place for a chat and a smoke with the old keeper, and a mug of ale, served by the fair hands of his daughter. Among those who frequented this rustic hostelry was one of those proletarian half-breed Mexicans, whose acidulate countenance was most odious to all, particularly the girl. On the other hand, her blue eyes, golden hair and sunny complexion inflamed him so as to make bold to kiss her. He is indignantly repulsed, receiving a blow on the face from the girl which sends him from the place, scowling and towering with rage. It is nightfall and the guests all having departed, the keeper leaves for a short jaunt up the road, warning the girl to be sure to lock up during his absence, which she does: then going to her room to prepare for her well-earned rest. She has just removed her waist when there is a knock at the door, and, thinking it is her father returning, she throws a mantilla over her shoulders and opens the door to the Mexican, who had seen her father depart. The cruel, black nature of the brute now asserts itself, and barring the door, he seizes the helpless girl, who screams and struggles until her father, bursting in, engages the half-breed in a fierce conflict, while the girl rushes out into the night. The Mexican having with a blow stunned the father, follows after her. Next we see the poor frail creature dashing wildly and almost aimlessly through the thick forest, coming at last, as morning breaks, to the cabin of her nearest neighbor. Staggering into the place in a state of exhaustion, she relates her experience to the miner's wife, who goes to bring her husband's aid. Hearing the Mexican's approach, the girl hides behind a curtain. In rushes the infuriated beast in search of his prey. While rummaging the place, he is attracted by the childish prattle of the miner's baby, who sits in its cradle playing with her dollie. His heart is softened by the pure, innocent chatter of the child, and he drops on his knees before the crib and prays to God to help him to resist his brutal inclinations. The girl, who Is deeply touched at this scene, comes from her hiding as he rises and is taken by the hand by her persecutor, who implores forgiveness, which is granted, and departs as she takes the baby in arms and kisses it in gratitude, for was it not her deliverer? \"And a little child shall lead them.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

He arranges a dinner at his mansion in which they are all invited. During the day he wrote a letter to himself to be delivered to him when the entertainment was at its height. This letter, purporting to be from his attorney, tells that he has been reduced to bankruptcy by the failure of his agents. Aha! Now we see who his friends are. He was all right while he had it, but now it is different, and they all leave him to his apparent fate, \"So this is what they call friendship. Well, it is as false as sin. But there is true friendship to be found, and I'll find it.\" So saying, he leaves behind his life of ease and enlists in the army of the low born. Securing a position as porter in a factory, he sees the other side of life: how those poor devils have to struggle for a livelihood, and yet how honest and open-hearted. None of that cringing deceit of his own set. At the factory there are employed a number of girls. Jennie Coleman, one of the prettiest, is offered an insult by the overseer, and Ross knocks him down for the affront. Jennie's heart went out at once to her protector, and from that time on they were friends, yes, friends, for true friendship is love refined, and purged from all its dross. They were often seen together, and little did Jennie dream of the real being of the man she put her trust in. It was not long before the arduous duties of the factory told on Ross, and he was at last thrown on his back by severe illness. In a poorly furnished room he lies, without those necessities so essential to his recovery. Here he is visited by faithful Jennie, who, finding him without food and other comforts, and penniless, she leaves him and repairs to a hairdressing establishment where she sells her wealth of blond hair, her crown of beauty of which she was pardonably proud, and with the proceeds purchases food and medicine. When Ross sees the terrible sacrifice the girl has made he deeply regrets going so far, and prays for life and strength to return materially this friendship. He is granted his wish, for they are married, and at the conclusion of the ceremony she is transported into what to her seems fairyland, clothed in gorgeous raiment and bedecked with jewels, with lackeys and servants in attendance. \"True friendship is one soul inhabiting two bodies.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The first picture shows him following a beautiful young woman down the street, and into an apartment where she goes to look at rooms. When the janitor shows the lady in the masher is close at her heels and tries in every way to attract her attention. His efforts are unsuccessful, however, as she utterly ignores him. But finally, so persistent does he become, that she, in an effort to rid herself of his presence, throws him on the floor and rushes out, locking him in the room. Soon we see him climbing out of the window and crawling along the ledge to another apartment in which a woman is seated reading. She is horrified when confronted by the stranger and is remonstrating with him for his audacity, when her husband enters, and mistaking the intruder for one of his wife's admirers, proceeds to give the innocent woman a beating, and follows the fellow downstairs, kicking him at every step. Undaunted by this harsh treatment, the young masher climbs up on a tram car, and seats himself between two women. He forces his attentions on one of the ladies, and at last becomes so obnoxious that her escort throws him down into the street and jumps down himself to have it out with him. The fellow overtakes a cab in which a young lady is riding, and to escape his enraged pursuer, he jumps in and explains the situation to the young woman, who is powerless to resist his entreaties, they soon arrive at the girl's home, and when they get out she tells her father of the stranger's conduct. The former not only administers a well deserved beating to the offender, but wipes up the thoroughfares with his remains.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Jean Durand","Released":"08 Aug 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"France","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Susceptible Youth","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"French","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

He resided luxuriously in bachelor apartments, surrounded by a coterie of agreeable companions. His social duties were that exigent as to prevent his working for a livelihood. Still the money must come from somewhere, so Reggie devised a scheme. His nearest kin and benefactor was an uncle, the Rev. Eben Haddock, who had often, in Reggie's extreme youth, lent a helping hand. The old gentleman was of a benevolent nature and Reggie felt sure of the successful outcome of his plan. Knowing that the old man's most ardent wish was that he, Reggie, should marry and settle down, he writes him that he had at last taken a wife, and of course Reggie's allowance was increased. This, in time, proved inadequate to his mode of living, and a second letter was dispatched that his reverence had been made a grand uncle, and another increase in the allowance was made. For two years everything went well, and Reggie was certainly tearing off the very best this old world affords. Nothing to do but spend Nunky's money. However, there came a jolt one morning, when Reggie receives a letter from his uncle stating he would arrive in New York that day for the sole purpose of seeing the wife and baby. \"Good heavens. I must have a wife, but how.\" Well. Timothy Tubbs, the valet, comes to his rescue, and suggests that Mrs. Tubbs play the wife. \"Fine, hut how about the kid?\" \"We'll have her bring along a baby.\" The scheme looked good, and Reggie telephones to the valet's wife to come to the apartments at once and bring a baby. Mrs. Tubbs, not unduly bright, thinks he means her own baby, a boy of fourteen. Meanwhile, the Rev. Eben Haddock has arrived and is anxious to see the family, but excuses are made, until at last Mrs. Tubbs dashes in with her boy. She is a sight, still Reggie must make the best of it: but it is out of the question to palm a fourteen-year-old boy off as a two-year-old infant, so Mrs. Tubbs is introduced as Mrs. Reggie Van Twiller and \"Buttons,\" the hallboy, is hustled to the orphan asylum to procure an infant. While uncle is shocked at the sight and manners of the pretended wife, he is annoyingly anxious to see the baby. Excuses are made that it is out with the nurse, and will be hack shortly. At last the word is given that baby is here, for \"Buttons\" has returned. Reggie at last breathes freely, but his case is of short duration, for the asylum nurse enters with the infant, and uncovering its face, one look was enough: \"Great Jupiter, it's a coon!\" Likely enough, for the order simply said \"a two-year-old infant,\" with no mention of race or color. Reggie feels that his meal ticket is irretrievably punched, so you may imagine his surprise when he sees that his uncle is not only amused at what he considers a great joke on Reggie, but greatly relieved to know that the awful freak was only a make-believe wife.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The door is thrown open, a messenger enters and delivers a message, presumably announcing the return of Olaf, her father. The daughter bedecks herself to fittingly welcome the returning warrior. Passing from the castle to the beach below, Olaf and his followers are just embarking. The Viking is dressed in a costume of the ancient warrior wearing armor and carrying sword and battle-axe He ascends the path to the castle, his men following. Between two of them walks Alfred, a young Saxon prisoner. They enter the castle, where Olaf is affectionately greeted by his daughter, who dismisses the attendants. When alone, Olaf presents the daughter with necklace, bracelets and jewels, the spoils of war. In the guard room of the castle the captive is seated on a bench, with soldiers carefully watching him. The door opens and Theckla enters, with a servant, carrying food and wine. The famished man looks up at the girl gratefully, while she starts in confusion at the manly prisoner. Alfred raises her hand to his lips in thanks for her kindness. At this moment Olaf enters. His daughter lays her hand on his arm, points to the prisoner, and pleads for him. The father shakes his head. At this juncture the high priest of Odin enters, hands a parchment to the Viking, who slowly unrolls it. He reads, \"Odin, the god of war, demands a sacrifice, and the prisoner must be offered up to-morrow at sunrise.\" Again Theckla pleads with her father, who shakes his head and points to the priest. He also is dumb to her entreaties, and commands her to leave the room. She rises, staggers and falls fainting in her father's arms. The following morning a procession of soldiers and priests, the captive walking between the latter, start for the temple, where the sacrifice is to be offered up. The prisoner is led to the altar and laid upon it. The priest takes a sacrificial knife from his girdle and is about to strike, when a messenger in terror rushes in and points towards the castle. The priests release Alfred and all start in the direction of the building. Over the rocky path it can be seen enveloped in flames and smoke. The young Saxon has outdistanced the others, and rushes into the burning building before his capturers are half-way up the summit. Inside Theckla is seated on a couch in deep dejection as a maid rushes into the room and excitedly points to the hall whence she has come. The young girl opens the door, but is beaten back by a cloud of smoke and flame. She sinks on her knees, raises her hands to heaven in prayer, then falls senseless on the couch. Alfred rushes in, seizes the unconscious girl in his arms and plunges out again through the flames. At the gate he comes upon Olaf and his followers, and places the daughter in her father's arms. She quickly revives, smiles in her father's face, and turns to her rescuer, who reverently kisses the hand held out to him. Again Theckla pleads with her parent, who grants his daughter's wish, and gives a command to one of his soldiers, who comes forward and gives a sword and helmet to Alfred, hails him as a hero and grants him his freedom. Then Olaf takes his daughter by one hand and her rescuer by the other, joins their hands and raises his own in blessing.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Adventure, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"J.

The transaction meets with repugnance from the girl. She was entirely contented with conditions, a child of nature, carefree. However, she finds her pleading of no avail, and so pretends to accept the situation. The trapper and Canadian go into the cabin to seal the bargain with a drink, and while inside the girl closes and fastens the door on them and makes her way through the woods to escape. The door fastening proves but a slight handicap, and the trapper is soon in pursuit. The girl comes upon a camping party who give her protection, driving the trapper off at point of gun. The next day, however, the trapper returns and surprising the girl, carries her off in a canoe, beating her into submission. Her cries alarm the campers and the men start off to her rescue. Although armed with guns, they dare not fire for fear of hitting the girl. Finally the trapper, after cuffing and kicking the poor girl, ties her to a tree, intimating that there she will remain until she promises tractability. While in this situation the rescuers approach stealthily and cover the trapper with a pistol, force him off while they release the poor girl. The trapper shows fight and is knocked down and about to be set upon by the men, but the girl seeing her tormentor's plight, at once changes heart, and picking up the pistol turns it on the would-be deliverers, who retire in amazement. The girl then throws herself into the trapper's arms. Woman, lovely woman, you are certainly a peculiar commodity. The scenes of the subject are extremely picturesque, with their beauty enhanced by appropriate tinting.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Griffith, Anthony O'Sullivan","Plot":"With the family of Mr. Phlipp there is employed that wrecker of domestic serenity, a pretty French maid, whose trim figure and cherry lips are simply irresistible. This is all very fine for Phlipp, who is wont to bask in the radiance of her smiles and to sip the honey from her rose-leaved lips. But, alas! his bliss is short-lived, for, the perspicacious Mrs. Phlipp grows suspicious and surprises the erring couple in an osculatory diversion. The meretricious maiden is put to right, and the sinful Phlipp is assailed with most vociferous vituperative verbosity. Storm after storm of opprobrium is hurled at him until with vermiculation his restrained rage bursts forth and he takes his spite, not by \"kicking the cat,\" but by smashing everything at hand. The wife, meanwhile, has gone to the newspaper office to advertise for a Chinese servant malum in se. The Confucian arrives, is put to work, and then the fun begins. His services in the library are dispensed with by the irate husband. Next he visits the dining-room, where a globe of live goldfish excites an appetite which he proceeds to appease. He has devoured several when his piscatorial pleasure is interrupted by the housekeeper, who drags him around the room by his queue, almost pulling it from his cranium. Now, the affairs gastronomic are presided over by a lady who answers to the name of Bridget, is of pronounced Hibernian proclivities, and has a strong aversion for anything yellow. What happens when she meets the Chink throws the \"Monkey and Parrot\" story into gossamer oblivion. They get along so nicely together, baud multum. He resents Bridget's sangfroid with a mouthful of water, spraying her visage as he would a shirt-front. Oh, fury! \"Going down?'' The Chink does; down the airshaft by way of the window, taking the sash with him, propelled by Bridget. There is a tacit understanding between Bridget and the Cop, so he makes his usual call and is being regaled with hot mince pie and coffee, when the saffron individual returns with a rat in a trap. At the right of the rat the muliebrity of Bridget asserts itself and up on a chair she leaps in terror, while the Cop fans the Chink, who drops the trap. The commotion brings the household to the kitchen in alarm. At the sight of the rat the women mount the table and chairs, while the Cop, hero of the occasion, throws the rattrap through the window, and peace again reigns. All this while there has been reposing within the incandescent walls of the gas range oven, a large succulent turkey, which during the hubbub is quite forgotten, and when the oven door is opened, there is smoke, nothing but smoke, which ends our story typically, as with many seemingly good schemes, this Chinese servant idea ends in smoke, and the Chink, like Othello, finds his occupation gone.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace McCutcheon","Released":"07 Mar 1908","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Yellow Peril","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Scarcely has the poor bereft father laid the little one in the ground, when the war cry is heard resounding in the hills. There is an uprising and the chief is summoned to action. Tearing himself from the grave of his little girl he arms himself with his assegai and oxhide shield and is soon at the head of his band of savages, with sinister designs on the Boers. The Boers themselves have become active, and scouts have been sent out to warn those nomadic South Africans who might be on the road. One family, comprising a Boer, his wife and a four-year-old girl, are, however, trapped, and despite extreme measures to elude the merciless black brutes, are soon overtaken. Finding escape hopeless, the Boer leaps from his wagon, and sending his wife and child into the woods, seizes his rifle, in the vain hope of holding the savages at bay while the woman and child seek a place of safety. There is a shower of assegais, one of which pierces the poor fellow, dropping him into the road. Up rush the prancing, jibbing, gibbering barbarians. Finding the man dead, they rush on to find the others. The distracted woman hides the girl in a niche in the rooks, while she goes to find some avenue of escape, but she is at once apprehended and taken by the band to their camp, their chief remaining behind. The baby now comes forward to appeal to the Zulu, who is so reminded by her of his own lost treasure that his cruel nature at once softens as the little one offers her dollie as ransom for her mother. The chief is so moved that he vows to save the mother's life, if it costs him his own. Placing the little one in a crevice in the rocks, where she soon falls asleep, he goes to find the mother. Arriving at the camp, he demands the release of the woman, which his followers grant with protests. Back he goes to get the child, but the wily devils have anticipated him and carried her off. He soon overtakes them, however, and after slaying three in a terrific conflict, delivers the child to its mother, and then sees them safely to their destination. The subject is a beautiful story of parental affection, portrayed in a most novel manner, besides being intensely thrilling.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Everything is disposed of when the little girl picks up the toy dog of her dead and gone brother, and says, \"Mamma, who takes this?\" Well the scene that transpires defies description and it is sufficient to say that it is the most touching episode ever portrayed.

Most persistent among her suitors was Grigo, a coarse Sicilian, whose advances were odiously repulsive. The arrival at the boarding house from the old country of Giuseppe Cassella, the violinist, filled the void in her yearning heart. Romantic, poetic and a talented musician, Giuseppe was indeed a desirable husband for Minnie. All this, of course, filled Grigo with bitter hatred and he vows vengeance, which you may be sure he will work with extreme subtlety. All preparations are made for the wedding, and when the day arrives Grigo is ready for it. He has contrived an infernal machine with a pistol so arranged that its explosion means death to anyone standing in front of it. The little church is decorated in honor of the affair and Grigo, with subterfuge, gets the sexton out, leaving the place to himself. Sawing a hole in front of the altar step, he places his weapon in such a position that one step forward by the priest would mean death to the bride kneeling in front. Grigo rushes hack to his room, arriving just as the wedding party is leaving for the church. Here he becomes a victim of the frenzy of his mind, and appreciating the fact that the awful deed will he laid to him and his apprehension will be inevitable, he writes a gloating note and then takes poison. His fall is heard by the housemaid, who, discovering the note, gives it to a policeman, who rushes madly to the church. Fate, however, seems to conspire, and the officer falls, breaking his ankle, just outside the church. A newsboy, seeing his plight, runs up, and the policeman directs him hurriedly to the church, where he arrives just in time to save the couple, who start back at his yell, for the priest had just made the step which fires the gun, but with no harm done. The priest gives thanks to God for their deliverance and proceeds with the wedding.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Before leaving the baby the poor mother takes one of its little shoes to keep as a memento. Returning to her cheerless home she is seized with a paroxysm and falls lifeless in a chair, with her little boy at her side. A neighbor hearing her cries runs for the parish priest, who finds the poor woman beyond human aid. Her soul has departed into eternity. She still clutches the little shoe which mutely tells the woman's sad story. The good priest takes the boy as well as his sister's shoe. Meanwhile the baby has been found by the banker and his wife and they decide to adopt it. Fifteen years elapse and we find the girl grown up in blissful ignorance of her origin, of course imagining the banker and his wife her parents, while the boy has gone through his collegiate course preparatory to Holy Orders. One afternoon while walking in the park the boy's attention is attracted by a runaway, and leaping to the roadway he seizes the bridle of a wild fractious horse and brings it to a standstill. Assisting the young lady occupant of the vehicle to a taxicab he escorts her to her home. A strong friendship between the two young people ripens later to love and the boy is seen struggling between the all-important questions as to his future, whether it be religious or secular. His love for the girl is so strong, so pure, that he determines to gain the old priest's consent to his marrying instead of entering the priesthood. What a blow it is to the good old father, but he feels it may be for the best and consents even to marry them. Now the banker's wife thinks it only just to the young people to reveal the truth about the girl, telling how she found her fifteen years before, and that one of her little shoes was missing. At this intelligence the old priest is staggered, for he sees at once that the marriage cannot take place; they are brother and sister. He raises his head in thanksgiving for the grace of God that brought about this timely revelation. However, brother and sister find \"The peace that passeth all understanding.\" She becomes a nun and he goes to his ordination into the priesthood, giving their future lives up to the honor and glory of the Divine Master whose guiding hand showed the better way.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

In this Hindu pantheon there gathered natives of the Ganges Valley of all castes, with the priests, their wives, and houris; also a generous sprinkling of Western tourists, they being drawn thither by their thirst for sight-seeing. Most kaleidoscopic was the scene as out of its midst towered the stately idol Brahma. In the forehead of the idol there was embedded a mammoth diamond of fabulous value. This was termed the \"Light of the World.\" Among the tourists there is one who, a stranger in a strange land, finds himself in a depleted condition as regards finances. Extravagant and improvident, he is piling up a bill at the Cawnpore Hotel without funds to meet it. The sight of this diamond at once arouses his cupidity and he determines to secure it at any hazard. A visit to the temple shows that the Brahma is attended by one veiled guard. He also learns that this guard has a sweetheart who visits him during his lonely vigil. Enlisting the services of an unscrupulous Hindu they follow the girl to her home where they force her and her father to go with them to the temple, where under threat of her father's murder she gives drugged wine to her lover, the guard. He immediately falls into a stupor, and binding the father and girl, the tourist seizes the diamond and makes his way back to the hotel. Recovering his senses, the guard gives alarm, and he and the girl are taken to prison where he is doomed to die at the end of three days for the desecration of Brahma. The girl, however, offers to remain hostage if her lover be allowed to search for the diamond. This noble offer is accepted and the girl is chained to the floor of the dungeon, while the guard, humiliated by the confiscation of his royal turban, according to the law, is set free to bring back if he can the diamond. Should he not succeed in the allotted time, three days, the girl will pay the penalty with her life. He first rushes to the Yogi, the royal seer, who shows him on the mystic mirror the face of the robber. The guard at once recognizes him as the tourist who had visited the temple, and sets out to find him, which he does at the hotel, just after the tourist has sewed the diamond up in the handle of his suit case. He contrives to engage himself as a servant and as such makes a fruitless search of the tourist's effects, He is on the point of despairing when the tourist is called upon by a diamond merchant. Effecting his presence in the room by hypnotic power, the guard manages to secure the diamond and dashing madly back to the dungeon arrives just in time to stay the uplifted scimitar from the neck of the faithful girl.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

How many of us are wont to look back and wish that we might blot out from our memory the ever recurring specter of the follies of our youth. Such was the experience of Henry J. Newman, a wealthy banker, who, in the flippant Spring of his life was guilty of a slight indiscretion which now in the sober Autumn of his existence seems so iniquitous that he fain would forget it, and above all keep it from knowledge of his family, not that it was enormous, for it was not, as Newman was a man whose standard of morals was high. However, this one false step was known of by Dick Folson, an unconscionable wretch, who, knowing Newman's sensitive nature, sees in the episode an elegant chance for graft, or rather blackmail, which he proceeds to take advantage of. He writes a letter to Newman telling him he has convincing proof of the affair and asking if it is worth to him $300 a month to keep mum. If not Mrs. Newman will be apprised of all. The letter arrives at a most opportune time to lend success to Folson's design, for Newman is surrounded by his little family, enjoying to the extreme mellifluous domesticity. He goes to his office and sends an answer to Folson saying that his demand is unreasonable and begging him to have pity. Folson writes an answer, but on second thought goes to Newman's office himself and to Newman's entreaties simply replies that it is either $300 a month, the first payment at once, or he will expose him to his wife. Newman at length yields and Folson goes away satisfied for the month at least. The money does not last long under the strain of Folson's dissipations and a week later finds him broke again. In this condition he is visited by one of his companions, who is setting out on a burglaring expedition and wants his assistance. In his present frame of mind he is ready for anything, and so readily consents, not even bothering to inquire where the job is to he pulled off. Arriving at the house they effect an entrance, and get to work gathering in the articles of value. It is not long before they are surprised by someone coming, and start to beat a hasty retreat. One of them gets out, but Folson stumbles and falls and the man of the house is on him, with revolver in hand. Folson scrambles to his feet and finds himself face to face with Newman. For a moment he feels easy, as he assumes he is safe, hut the awful reality dawns on him when Newman tells him he can now without compunction put him out of the way forever, for is he not a burglar? And is it not perfectly reasonable for him to shoot him as such? Well yon may he sure that Newman does not let slip this opportunity of assuring himself and his family peace of mind from now on, so when the police carry off the inanimate form of the intruder.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Confidence is the flower grown from the seed of true friendship, watered by the tears of adversity, and often assailed by the blight of calumny. For as Shakespeare says', \"be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.\" So it was with little Nellie Burton, the orphan girl of the rancho, who budding into womanhood, realizes her position and appreciates the low brutal character of the habitués of the Dive, even discerning the true nature of her fancied sweetheart, Jim Colt, who was to say the least an unconscionable villain. Tiring of her present environments she decides to leave the place seek a nobler and higher life. To this end she makes her way eastward and applies for a position as nurse at a New York hospital, and we next find her engaged in that work of mercy \"ministering to the sick.\" Her mild manners and pure nature impress the head surgeon, a man of eminence in his profession, to such an extent that he finds himself deeply in love with this poor self-sacrificing girl. He proposes marriage, which she at first mildly declines, but he at length persuades her, and they are married. However, there must come a cloud, and this is in the shape of her girlhood sweetheart, Colt, who has migrated East, and living on his wits. He runs across Nellie in the company with her husband as she enters her own home. The low conniving nature at once asserts itself and he plans a scheme of blackmail, using as capital her pure innocent love letters. Waiting a favorable opportunity, Jim Colt \"visits'' her and with a threat of showing these letters to her husband he extorts money from her. This gone he comes for more, and as she has no ready cash he takes her jewels. The money raised on these goes the same way, so he calls to make another demand. This the poor helpless girl finds unable to meet, and during their argument the surgeon enters. Colt then hands the missives over to the husband who, taking the packet throws them into the tire and has Colt forcibly ejected from the place, with the positive injunction never to return.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

As he leaves the tenement he vows to get even, and lies in wait until Galora has gone out on business.

They are now in a quandary as to how to rescue the child, for to raise the window meant certain death. At last Galora suggests they let down the top sash and he is held by the feet as head down he lifts the baby from its perilous position into the room.

Several of the guests are put under the influence and made to perform most ridiculous antics, to their embarrassment upon reviving. The daughter of the host is the last to be subjected to the professor's power, and she proves to be such a good subject that the professor at once resolves to make her his unconscious agent in a dastardly plot he at once evolves. Opportunity serves him most graciously, for he meets the lady on the street and, hypnotizing her, suggests she return to her home and rob her father's desk of a large sum of money. The scheme seems to work, but it is an acknowledged fact that a person of good morals cannot be made to commit a crime, by hypnotism, and so, although the girl goes to the house, and even opens the drawer in which the money is placed, she returns without it. On her way back she is followed by her sweetheart, who assails the professor, but is worsted, gagged and bound. Back the professor sends the girl, he following, and at the home she somnambulistically leads him to the desk. He takes the money and leaves her under his hypnotic power. In this condition her father finds her, and failing to arouse her, calls the family physician, who at once suggests a celebrated mind specialist. He is hurriedly called, and using his powers of suggestion on her she is induced to retrace her steps, followed by her father and the doctors. Meanwhile the professor has arrived at his rooms and is hastily packing his effects preparatory to skipping; when the girl and her father, followed by the doctors and a couple of policemen, enter. The professor is overpowered, and made to resuscitate the girl, and taken into custody by the policemen.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Crime","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

She suddenly becomes a butterfly, and as the knight approaches her, the wings of the butterfly give way to the huge tentacles of a giant spider or octopus, which reach out for Don Quixote and try to grasp him.

Johnson, Marion Leonard, Florence Lawrence, Linda Arvidson","Plot":"Harry Walker, a wealthy young business man, had been carrying on for some time a flirtation with Mme. Lebrun, a young widow, who, though he fancied as a friend, had not considered her very seriously. She, on the other hand, had mistaken his platonic attentions for love and when he informs her of his engagement to marry Mignon Parsons, she flies into a jealous rage, threatening dire vengeance. Walker does not appreciate the strength of her avowal, and leaves, promising to return to her her letters in his possession. But Walker little knows the fury of a woman scorned, and she at once sets to work to wreak a vengeance that is as cunning as it is terrible. Procuring a box of the choicest candy she injects a drug into each particle, and writes a note, cleverly imitating his handwriting. These she sends to Mignon who resides about ten miles distant, by a messenger boy. Some time after Harry calls in his automobile with the letters. These he gives to Mme. Lebrun, who goes to her boudoir to get his letters. While she is absent he sees the evidence of her treachery on her writing table. On her return he accuses her and she taunts him in his apparent helplessness to rescue his fiancé from her impending danger. Here he is, ten miles away, and the messenger, who has much the start of him speeding by railway towards the goal. Hurling the woman aside, with an invective of denunciation, he rushes to his automobile and commands the chauffeur to drive on, disregarding all speed laws, for it is life and death in the balance. On they go like mad through lanes, around curves, over hills, slowing up for nothing. At one point in the journey a toll gate is closed, but it proves to be no handicap, for they come on relentlessly plowing through the obstacle, smashing it into pieces. At another point a farmer's wagon is seen trolling slowly across the road, and the auto coming on at a furious speed, hits and demolishes it, and passes leaving the poor farmer ruefully gazing upon the wreck. On, on goes the auto until Mignon's house is reached. But the messenger boy has arrived, delivered his charge and departed. The box is open, the note is read, and the first luscious confection lifted to the lips, when Harry rushes in, dashes the candy to the floor and folds the amazed Mignon in his arms, \"Saved.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

An old Spanish Hidalgo becomes deeply involved in financial reverses and Manuella, a wealthy ranchero, helps him out. However, things have gone from bad to worse, and the old man finds himself at the mercy of Manuella, who, while not of the Draconian nature, of course expects his money or the security. He calls to apprise the old man that his notes are overdue, and insists upon a settlement, which the poor old fellow is unable to do. While there he meets Mercedes, the old man's beautiful daughter, and falls deeply in love with her, and offers to cancel the obligations for the daughter's hand in marriage. Now Mercedes is enamored of Carlos, a poor peon of the village, whom she loves in return and when the suggestion of the ranchero is broached she indignantly repulses it. However, upon realizing her poor father's condition she decides to make the sacrifice and consents. She then bids Carlos call to see her to break the unpleasant intelligence to him and part company. The lover calls and is almost heartbroken when Mercedes tells him the sad news. While they are engaged in the act of separating, the ranchero enters the adjoining room and through the half open door hears the sorrowful word of the last farewell between the young couple. He is so touched by the pure, self-sacrificing love of the lovers, that he softens and feels he is worthy of bitter reproach for being the instrument of tearing asunder two trusting hearts such as these, so he makes up his mind that such shall not be. He then enters the room, and bidding the young ones to be of good heart, he not only joins their hands in bonds of true love, but makes them a present of the promissory notes which he had threateningly held over her father's head but a few moments before. This is one case of where eavesdropping was attended by ecstatic results.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

That Harry and Margie deeply loved each other is most apparent; that Dad had a strong aversion for Harry as a son-in-law is also apparent, and when he finds them in clandestine conference there is something doing. Harry is chased about the room by Dad with a cane, which in a wild sweep at Harry goes through a pier mirror. Oh, the woe of it. This might be considered ominous, and it was for Dad, but it was the omen of good fortune for the lovers. As an extreme measure Dad decides to send Margie to Europe with his sister, her aunty, to be out of reach of Harry. Bright scheme, you would say. Well Aunty's vanity was the undoing. She insists on a new and elaborate gown, so Dad gives her the money to buy it. Harry learns of this and follows Aunty to the store and buys an exact duplicate of her traveling outfit. Attired in it he visits Margie's home. Upon entering he is almost confronted by Aunty similarly attired. To hide he dodges behind the mirror, and oh horror, the broken glass has been removed. Here is a predicament. Aunty is approaching. Ah! an idea. Harry stands his ground and when Aunty comes to the mirror, she also not knowing it has been removed, he mimics her antics to a nicety, so she imagines him a reflex, and so exits perfectly satisfied with herself. Dad then appears and shoving a roll of bills into masquerading Harry's hand, sends him off with Margie for Europe (?), but instead they go to the minister's.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Of course Aunty comes, and is accompanied by the Rev. Joshua Whittington, the gentleman who has done the deed for the young couple. No sooner have they set foot on the place than the trouble begins. First of all, Aunty and the reverend gentleman object strenuously to the candied affection indulged in by the young couple. Then they proceed to run things to their own Ideas. The cook does not furnish the table to suit them, so there is trouble in the kitchen; the servants are not alert enough, so they fall in for a share of the interlopers' despotism: and soon the household is in a tumult verging upon insurrection. At last a shaft of light breaks in upon the dark and stormy aspect in the person of Bill Corker, an old college chum of Tom's, who is the comedian of a show playing in the town, and he calls. Hearing the tale of woe of his friends, he volunteers to help them out. Well, talk about a \"monkey and parrot\" time: Bill plays the leading role in the funniest comedy he has ever done in the whole course of his histrionic career. Many things are pulled, but the climax comes when Bill, in a fire-eating cowboy makeup, chases the odious visitors out of the house, down the road to the railroad station, where they both leap on a moving train which carries them cityward, presumably thanking a benevolent Providence that they have escaped with their lives, no doubt to ejaculate whenever Norton Villa is mentioned, \"Never again.\" So, though Bill was not a friend in need, he was a friend indeed.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The Biograph here holds up to your pity a court-fool, whose inordinate love for his child prompted him to plan vengeance which reverted upon himself. The Duke suffers from melancholia and his courtiers are at wits' end to dissipate his ennui. Diversion of all sorts are brought, but without success, until at last they decide to abduct the pretty daughter of the fool and bring her to the Duke. This is effected, and when the Duke sees her he falls deeply in love with her, but her pure innocence instills in him a higher, holier devotion than he was accustomed to experience, so he harkens to her plea, and throwing his cloak about her, sees her safely home. This is witnessed by the fool, who is in hiding, and misjudging the Duke's attitude, vows vengeance. To this end he enlists the services of a nomad couple who are dwelling in a hut not far off. He bargains with them that to kill the man he shall point out he will pay them five hundred louis. The pact is made, and the Duke is pointed out to them by the fool as he strolls in the gardens with the girl. As the Duke leaves the girl she espies the trio skulking on the grounds and follows them to the hut, where she overhears the plan. She at once decides to save the Duke, but how? To tell him would incriminate her old father. Nothing seems feasible but self-sacrifice, which she bravely determines to do. Going to her house, she dons male attire and with the cloak the Duke had loaned her thrown over her shoulders she bids adieu to her home and life and like a soldier goes bravely unto death. Entering the hut, her face hidden, she receives the blow intended for another and dies before the horror-stricken gypsy couple, who discover their mistake. They, however, put her body in a sack, and when the fool appears, collect their promised fee and flee. The fool is now in a state of fiendish exultation over the seeming success of his vengeance, and after dancing gleefully around the sack, determines to make away with it, but upon picking it up is startled by the litheness of the form enclosed. Ripping open the sack, the sight that greets him fairly freezes his blood, for there lies his own daughter, cold in death, a victim of his own dastardly plot. This final scene is without doubt the most intense bit of work ever done in motion pictures.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Contrasted with the brilliant throng we see a little child shivering in the snow, with her little wooden shoe held out expectant of a coin from those charitably disposed. But in the intoxicating jollity of the occasion the poor soul is passed by unnoticed until, exhausted, she sinks upon the stone step and sleeps. There now passes a kindly spirited knight, who flicks a Louis d'Or into the tiny wooden slipper at her side. Meanwhile, at the gambling house there has run to ruin at roulette a young blade, who is tipped that on the strike of twelve the number 17 is sure to come out. So impressed is he that he tries to borrow, in the hope of recouping his lost fortune, but his friends turn coldly away. From the place he saunters despondently and comes upon the little one on the step, still asleep. His hand, through habit, goes to his own pocket, hut, alas! It is empty. As he stands and contemplates the little one his eyes strikes the Louis d'Or. \"An Idea! I will borrow the coin, play 17, and win her a fortune.\" Back to the hall he rushes, reaching there upon the stroke of twelve. Hurling the coin upon the table he yells \"17,\" and 17 wins. He lays his winnings and wins again. Again and again he doubles his wealth until the bank is broken. Back he goes to repay with interest the \"borrowed\" Louis, but what a sight greets him. \"Dead, and I have murdered her!\" and taking the death-stained gold he scatters it in the snow.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Jones does, though, with great success. But, then. Eddie has never fallen down yet, although he has gotten into some awkward positions. Wifey's mamma promises, or rather threatens, a visit. This, of course, is most delectable news to Jones: \"not\" and when she arrives he is further perturbed by her egotistical domination of the household. Son-in-law must not smoke, nor drink; the maid must not frill nor flounce, but attire herself austerely demure. To say that this gets on Jones' nerves is putting it mildly, but what can he do? \"Ah! an inspiration. It takes nerve, but it is worth a chance.\" So he sets out, to make his wife jealous of her own mother. First he goes out and buys her candy and flowers, then he showers attentions upon her to the extreme neglect of wifey, which starts things in the right direction for Jones. After this he takes mamma dear to the milliner's and buys her a Merry Widow creation that is a marvel of merchandises de mode. All this, of course, costs money, but it is well spent, for the effect is very apparent, and the master stroke was struck when Jones takes mamma to Rector's and introduces to her notice that effervescent bubble water, champagne. Well, you see the stiff, prim old lady soften and become the giddiest girl extant. Back home they go, and it is all off between mother and daughter, and Mrs. Jones packs up mamma's duds and fairly throws her out of the house, with an injunction to go away and never come back. Of course, Jones is in bad for a time, but when he explains that what he did was induced by his selfish love to have wifey all to himself, he is forgiven and receives the usual \"make-up\" kiss.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

They figure that if one could only gain an entrance, a rich haul would be the reward. Many plans were devised and discarded, until Grattan, who is a handsome chap, resolved to perpetrate his evil design by way of the daughter, Rachel's heart. Rachel falls an easy victim to the flattering Ned, and accompanying him to a dance, consents to his proposal that they elope the following evening. Ned arrives at the pawnshop after closing time, and is admitted by Rachel. While she is upstairs getting her things, Ned admits Murphy. Poor trusting Rachel descends to be knocked on the head, gagged and bound to the newel post of the stairway. Mr. Einstein, missing his daughter, comes down into the shop only to receive a like treatment. The crooks then pile a lot of rubbish in front of Rachel and saturate it with kerosene. On top of this they place a lighted candle, so that when the dip burns down it will set fire to the rubbish, incinerating the pair, at the same time allowing them to make good their escape, a slow fuse as it were. Up the stairs they dash and rifle the money safe in Einstein's room. Meanwhile, Rachel has worked herself down until her hands come in contact with the candle's flame, with which she burns the binding of her wrists. Her hands free, she releases herself from the post, and rushing back of the counter, takes up two revolvers, holding up the two crooks as they descend into the store, commanding them to put down their loot and forcing Grattan himself to telephone for the police, who arrive immediately, taking the thieves in charge, much to the satisfaction of Einstein, who is released and revived.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Crime","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Hugo, on the front seat, drives lazily: Bill, his companion, sits on the back of the wagon smoking, while Liza, another member of the tribe, walks behind. They come to the farm house of Mr. Graham, where Jessie, his little daughter of 5 years, is playing in the yard. Bill and Liza approach the house and ask for food and money, which is refused by Mrs. Graham. Her husband comes from behind the house at this moment and gruffly orders the gypsies away. They walk off sullenly and a few moments later return and kidnap the little child. The mother soon misses Jessie, suspects the gypsies and Mr. Graham and several neighbors start in pursuit. The gypsies observe the pursuing party. The child is bound and gagged and secreted in a hollow tree, and when the party reaches the camp no trace of the missing child can be found and they return sadly home. Ten years later we find the same tribe encamped on the bank of a river. Jessie, by this time, has grown to a beautiful young lady. She is sewing as Joe, a young gypsy of her own age, comes along and speaks to her. Bill watches the couple jealously. Liza is in love with Bill, and, when she observes his infatuation for Jessie, shakes her list in jealous rage. Jessie dances, while Joe accompanies her on his guitar, and. when she finishes, Bill grasps her around the waist and kisses her. The young man drops his instrument, knocks Bill down and chokes him into silence. Liza motions the young people to get away, which they do, and a little distance up the road, she joins them, and from a bundle which she carries in her arm takes out some child's clothes, the ones worn by Jessie when she was stolen from home. The story of the abduction is told. Liza directs the girl to her parents, then returns to camp. Bill, by this time, has regained his senses and is sitting near the fire smoking and in a very bad humor. He inquires of Liza as to the whereabouts of the young girl, and, receiving no satisfaction, starts out to hunt the fugitives. As he mounts his horse. Liza knocks him off and mounts herself, and is off after the pair. She comes up with them after a while, and the journey home is at last finished. Graham and his wife, with a farmhand, are seated in the doorway as the gypsies appear. Liza goes forward and talks to Mr. Graham, who at first refuses to believe her story. She brings Jessie forward and produces the clothes worn by the child when stolen. This is sufficient proof, and Jessie is soon in fond embrace of mother and father. They lead her into the house, Joe following. Liza stands aloof watching them, then slowly and sadly walks away.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Van Dyke Brooke","Released":"09 Feb 1909","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Jessie, the Stolen Child","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Johnson, Owen Moore, Florence Lawrence, Marion Leonard","Plot":"John Hale and Frank Allison have become staunch friends at college, and the day of separation, at the end of the course, was a sad one indeed, particularly for Frank when he discovered that his little crippled sister, Mary, had fallen deeply in love with Jack. Jack goes out into the world, meets and becomes smitten with Miss Dorothy Kirk, a cold, heartless beauty. Dorothy had engaged herself to several worthy young men, but her capriciousness had caused her to throw them aside, so when she is sought by John Hale we feel that she has at last found her affinity. They are engaged and the affinition sealed with a ring, but the usual change of heart comes, and this time on the day of their to-be nuptials, when Jack receives the following note: \"Mr. John Hale, Dear Sir: Am sorry to write I cannot marry you to-day or ever. Pardon delaying my decision until the last moment, but better late than never. Dorothy Kirk.\" At the same time returning his ring. Humiliated and crushed, Jack stood in his wedding clothes, hardly realizing the cruel truth. From that moment a change comes over him; the noble, manly, courageous fellow becomes in spirit a weakling. Down, down he goes, disappointed, discouraged and distressed, until we find him simply a drink-devastated, emaciated human frame as he enters a saloon to buy a drink. While seated at one of the tables he glances over a newspaper and an article strikes his eye announcing the marriage of his college chum, Frank Allison, to Miss Dorothy Kirk on that afternoon. Rushing from the place on vengeance bent he makes his way to Frank's home to give him that awful note she had sent him some time before, but when he sees Frank so radiantly happy he decides to hold his peace and crushes the note in his hand out of sight. Frank, upon seeing his awful plight, prevails upon him to stay. As he leaves for the adjoining room he drops the note, which Frank picks up and reads. He now realizes the cause of his chum's condition, and in an instant his love turns to hate, so he resolves to pay her back in her own coin. He writes a note identical in wording with hers, addressing it \"Miss Dorothy Kirk\"; signing it \"Frank Allison.\" Feigning illness he dispatches it by Jack, who assumes it an excuse for illness. In he rushes in the midst of the wedding throng. You may imagine the scene. Here Jack unwittingly wreaks vengeance. On Jack's return to Frank he finds little sister Mary's hand held out helpingly to him.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

His latest episode is an experience with a female book agent, who tried to sell him a book entitled. \"How to Be Happy, Tho' Wedded.\" The work does not appeal to affable Edward, and he with gentlemanly firmness ejects her from his office, as his friend Dick Smith enters, to whom he mimics the ludicrous antics of his visitor. All this is witnessed by this modern Clio, who is peeking through the keyhole. She vows to be revenged, and seeing a box of gloves which Jones has bought for his wife, she substitutes her corsets for the gloves, writes a note which she puts in his overcoat pocket, asking him to return her corsets, and finally sends a letter to Mrs. Jones warning her of her husband's perfidy and to search his pockets for proof. Does the scheme work? Well there seems to a certainty a case of \"Jones vs. Jones\" appearing on the calendar of the divorce court in the near future, but the book agent becomes conscience stricken and sends a letter of contrition to Mr. and Mrs. Jones, explaining everything. Peace again reigns and Jones receives the osculatory balm on his throbbing forehead.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Jones had never been considered even a \"near-actor,\" but when he is selected to play the lover to Mrs. Trouble he is a brilliant success: so much so that Mrs. Jones insists upon playing the part. With this change, Jones' histrionic ability deserts him, and he is a \"frost.\" Well, things move along at a pretty rapid pace with the party, until Jones, in a jealous rage, ejects the bunch. The film is really one of the funniest of the Jones series.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Such was the condition of Lady Helen, who had everything she could wish for, and in consequence felt very much bored. In her ennui she longs for excitement, for some new sensation, but in vain, until looking over the newspaper she is seized with an irresistible inclination of going out to work, so incognito engages as a domestic in a boarding house. Here she makes a ludicrous attempt to cook, etc., and of course, being totally ignorant of the culinary art, meets with meagre success. However, her pretty face and ill-concealed refinement make such a strong impression upon the male contingent, that they make no complaints at her cooking, and would have taken even poison if served by her fair hands. Two hallroom boys are particularly smitten. Among the boarders there is a talented musician, and his gentle manners and wonderful talent appeal strongly to Lady Helen. He on the other hand, not knowing of course her true self, falls in love with her. All this is most agreeable to the women folks, who at once conspire to rid the place of her, which one brings about by having her accused of the theft of the musician's violin. He, of course, believes her innocent, but she is discharged nevertheless. Lady Helen is so moved by the poor fellow's kindness, that she interests herself in his behalf and secures for him a position as a director at the Conservatory, for which he calls to thank her and finding her a lady of quality would shrink humbly from her presence, but she will not let him for she too loves him. The subject as a whole is a decidedly amusing comedy drama, with a pretty love story running through it.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"D.W.

Poor Jack is a miserable spectator at the wedding. Jim and his bride have ensconced in their little flat, and are enjoying their first meal. Sad to say, Gertie's education in the art of cooking has been woefully neglected and the result of her first attempt is simply awful. It is so bad that Jim kicks, and in return for his vehement vituperation he receives the little delicate attentions that Xanthippe bestowed upon Socrates. Numerous articles of tableware at his head, sweet-tempered Gertie, lucky Jim. Meanwhile unlucky Jack is at home repining before a portrait of Gertie. Time goes on and poor Jack is still repining, when a notice in the newspaper is shown him which chronicles the intelligence that Jim has shuffled, a victim of acute indigestion, and his head is now adorned with a halo instead of the rim of a dishpan. Jack feels that here is his chance, and Gertie is more interesting than before from the fact of being a widow, so he makes his appeal and is accepted.

Hence it is when Isabelle appears on the scene clad in a gown that is a masterpiece of the dressmaker's art she easily fascinates the male contingent, among whom is Enrico, the sweetheart of Veronica, a street singer. Enrico is so enraptured at the sight of Isabelle in her resplendent attire that he becomes her abject slave, casting aside the poor, peasant-clad little Italian street singer, who has loved him devotedly. Crushed almost beyond endurance the poor girl stands sobbing at the entrance of the park where the inconsistent lever left her. Her tears attract the attention of a wealthy young couple who happen to pass. In answer to their queries she tells them how contemptibly her sweetheart acted, and all because of the fascinating influence of a gown. The lady is moved to commiseration and offers her aid in the gift of the most beautiful gown Veronica has ever seen. Her opportunity for revenge has turned her love to hate, and as she appears at the Italian Benevolent Association ball, she is the star of the event, for she looks like a queen as she promenades the ball room. She at once becomes the \"Mrs. Trouble\" of the evening, for the men all desert their partners and flock around her, beseeching but a smile. All this elicits from the women folk delicate little bon-mots such as \"Hussy.\" \"Temptress.\" \"Cat,\" \"False hair.\" \"Paints.\" Oh, well, you know how it is. Enrico is thrown into a rage that runs the entire gamut of emotions, love, jealousy, hate, disappointment and a few others, too numerous to mention here. He begs forgiveness, declaring undying love, but she tells him it is the gown that has attracted him and not her, but on his knees he swears. Still she will not trust him and turns to a poor good-hearted Italian who has persistently loved her despite her coldness.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Mrs. Ross, whose mother is very ill, has in attendance a trained nurse, who has received an urgent message to come to her own home, owing to the illness of her sister. As Mrs. Ross is dressed and ready to attend an afternoon tea at Mrs. Parker's, this forced absence of the nurse is very inopportune. However, little Alice. Mrs. Ross's seven-year-old daughter, is a bright child, so she feels that she can trust her to look after her grandma, and give her the medicine at the regular intervals. Mrs. Ross, herself, is suffering from a painful abrasion on her hand, for which she has procured an antiseptic to bathe it with, which is a deadly poison. It happens that the antiseptic and grandma's medicine are contained in similar-shaped bottles, and Mrs. Ross in her hurry and excitement takes away the wrong bottle. While at Mrs. Parker's, the hostess cuts her finger with a paper knife and Mrs. Ross offers her the antiseptic to bathe it. When she discovers she has carried away the medicine, leaving the poison for the child to give grandma. Looking at the clock, she finds it is on the hour of the administering of the dose. The poor woman is beside herself in fearful helplessness, when Mrs. Parker suggests the telephone. This she tries, and she is put in further trepidation at her inability to get connection, for at Central the operators are too busy chatting to take notice. She at length gets her home and is relieved to learn from the child that grandma has not been given the poison, owing to the fact that baby had spilt the first spoonful she poured out.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

The strength of this is better understood when we realize the impetuous nature of the Latin type of person. The Senorita, to tease her sweetheart, pretends love for an American soldier, and for a while it looks as if the little detachment of soldiers would be forced to bestow the last military honors on one of their number. However, by a clever trick, Senorita rights the impending wrong; the soldier escapes without a scar, and the sweethearts are left enjoying their cigarettes. This subject, while being short, is one of the most beautiful pieces of high-class acting ever attempted, the leading character being played by a native Spaniard.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

But Oh! the ordeal, for such it was, was telling on him, and his pent-up spirits were threatening ebullition, when at last the chance comes. The league arranges to attend a three-days' convention out of town, and when Mrs. Jones departs, Jones sends a note to Smith, telling him to bring the gang, and they would have a \"Prayer Meeting,\" enjoining him not to forget the \"fixings.\" Well, the gang are not long in putting in an appearance, for they feel that every minute's delay is a chunk lost from a golden opportunity for fun. Of \"fixing\" there is much, and it isn't long before they are in the \"Wild Indian\" stage of inebriety. During this time the feminine nemesis of Rum, the League has arrived at the station just in time to see the train pull out. Madder than wet hens, they decide to pass the night with Mrs. Jones. \"Oh, horror! Oh horror! a couple of times.\" Does not your sympathetic heart go out to poor unsuspecting Jones who in the meantime has gotten into a glorious condition, and the gang dress him in one of his wife's gowns, paint his face, carry him to the bedroom and throw him into bed, covering him up with the bedclothes. At this moment the prohibition party are seen approaching the house. The men hide as best they can the \"fixings,\" and are sitting reading books entitled \"Down with Rum\" when the ladies enter. They of course are delighted at this sight, and the absence of Jones is explained by a faked note calling him to attend a sick friend, noble Jones. The ladies go to the bedroom to remove their wraps, and their intrusion arouses Jones, who, not recognizing them, makes a dash for them, at which they all rush wildly into the drawing room, screaming that there is a madman in the bedroom. The men then rush in and while pretending to annihilate the imagined maniac they tidy up Jones and slip him through the window, that he may go around and enter the front door. The fright attending this episode has somewhat sobered him and everything would have been well had not Mrs. J. got a whiff of his breath. Even this would have passed, but Sister Anderson spies the bottles. Well, it's all off. It looks bad for Jones until the gang step forward and claim all the blame, as Jones was not even present. Here Jones makes the bluff and exclaims majestically. \"Madam, nimium de crede colori!\" or, in other words, \"Trust not to appearances.\" and the bluff goes.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Cumpson","Plot":"The pretty little romance which forms the plot of this subject shows one of the subtle ways Cupid has in bringing about the affined condition in two hearts entirely unlooked for. Ella Berlins is engaged as a shoe packer at the Lone Star Shoe Factory, and by way of a lark, and egged on by her companions, writes a note of usual type and places it in the lining of a shoe. The shoe is one of a consignment to a retailer, and falls into the hands of one of his best customers, although an awful grouch. In a fury he returns the shoes with what he considers an insulting note, and declares he will buy his shoes elsewhere in the future. The dealer is at first inclined to feel amused over the incident, but when he realizes the loss be suffers, he at once writes of the affair to the manufacturer. The result is that Ella is called before the proprietor and fired. However, her sweet, innocent face makes such an impression on the proprietor that he reconsiders her dismissal and she returns to work. He now sees her often as she busies herself among the others packing shoes, and the more he sees her the more impressed he becomes, until at length, well, she is simply out of place as far as he is concerned, and with some trumped up offense she is fired again. Sorrowfully she goes home and to her mother's query as to why she was discharged she has no answer for she does not know. She can simply sigh forth the time-worn expression, \"1 didn't do anything.\" While they are sorrowing there is a knock, and mother answers, opening the door to the boss. He enters sternly and starts in to scold Ella unsparingly, finishing by saying that as a shoe packer she is an awful failure, but as his wife she, he knew, would be the greatest kind of success. \"Now, who'd a thought it?\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Johnson, Florence Lawrence, Marion Leonard, Charles Inslee","Plot":"Policeman John Murray is the proud father of a little girl and the happy husband of a dutiful wife. Both father's and mother's whole life is centered in their little one, and the little family are as happy as can be until death tears the baby from them. As the child's soul leaves its body, so the poor heart-broken mother's reason leaves her. What an awful blow to Murray. The loss of his child was indeed hard to bear, but his dear wife hurled into a living death was worse. A trained nurse must be her constant companion, and the poor woman spent her time fondling the dolls and playthings of her lost one. Murray's beat lay in the tenderloin section of the city, and many curious characters came under his notice. In the cellar under a junk shop there lived, or rather existed, a Sicilian couple of the very lowest type, who eked an existence by begging and theft. A little orphan girl fell into their keeping and they forced her to beg on the street for them, beating her into submission if she refused, which the child's proud spirit inclined her to do. Out in the snow storm, thinly clad, the poor child was made to stand at the stage doors of the theaters or in front of saloons to work upon the sympathy of the generous-hearted habitués. She was always accompanied by the Sicilian woman, who took good care that she didn't escape. Murray, on his rounds, runs into them and his suspicions are aroused, so he follows them and enters their hovel just in time to see the poor creature receiving a frightful beating. With a terrific blow he sends the man reeling to the floor and hurling the woman on top of him he seizes the child in his arms. At this moment a couple of his squad, in answer to his whistle, enter and take the Sicilians in charge. An idea dawns on him. He takes the little one home and presents her to his poor demented wife. The presence of the child at once restores her reason, so the clouds of sorrow are dissipated and happiness reigns. The picture presents a moral showing the singular working of God's justice in taking to Himself an unsullied soul that another might be saved.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

Cumpson, Florence Lawrence, Linda Arvidson, Charles Avery","Plot":"No more popular fad has ever struck the feminine fancy than the peachbasket hat. This is a creation of headgear that for size outstrips anything yet designed by the disordered mind of the modiste. As a \"skypiece\" it is a \"skyscraper,\" and in decoration it looks like a combination horticultural and food exhibition. Nevertheless, this mammoth \"lid\" was seized onto by the feminine world with the avidity of a boy for his first baseball suit. It is only natural that our friend, Mrs. Jones, should experience this obsession, and what woe it preambled! The Jones family are seated at breakfast. Mr. Jones is reading the morning paper. An account of a kidnapping by gypsies engages his attention, and he is filled with horror at the anticipation of the possible abduction of his young hopeful, a baby one year old. He tries to impress Mrs. J., but she is fascinated by the millinery \"ads.\" The situation for Jones becomes more tense when on going outside he sees a couple of the odious gypsies with a child. Mrs. Jones takes herself off to buy a peachbasket, leaving baby in charge of the nurse, who, being of a romantic nature, enlists the services of the gypsies to tell her fortune. Mrs. Jones returns and almost catches the nursemaid, who is quite beside herself at her near discovery. Mrs. Jones places the huge box containing the hat on the table, while the nurse, placing the baby on the floor, assists in extricating the hat from its crate. Putting on the hat, Mrs. J. goes into the next room, followed by the maid, to view the effect in the mirror. .Mr. Jones now arrives, and his first thought is for baby; he cares naught for the peachbasket hat. Baby is nowhere to be seen. The nurse, in her excitement, does not remember where she placed it. Through the house they rush fruitlessly; out on the road and on after the disappearing gypsies, who are overtaken only to find that the baby the woman carries is not a Jones. The clouds of despair o'ershadow the couple in their dining-room, when suddenly the hat box on the floor is seen to move. There, under the hollow cube of pasteboard, is found baby Jones, the box having been blown by a gust of wind off the table over the child.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.
