Anna, piqued at Bob's adherence to parental wishes, hastily marries a working boy, Jim Whitcomb, and in the six years that follow, becomes addicted to liquor. Jim, himself, a drunkard, comes home one day to find Anna drunk and carousing. In the scene that followed, Anna, laughing derisively, informs Jim that Bob, now a devout priest, is the father of their six-year-old child. After that Anna takes the downward path and Jim finds consolation in saloons. One day, on charity bent, Father Bob goes into the slums. Accidentally he finds the child, and thinking it one of the city's waifs, notifies his mother to call and get it. Entering a dive, Bob is horrified to find Anna--\"not as they parted in the years gone by\"--but Anna is too drunk to recognize Bob. REEL 2.--Mrs. Carroll called with Bob and took the child to the Society of Cruelty to Children. Anna returning one day, finds Bob's note telling of the child's whereabouts. Mrs. Carroll often met Anna at the Society's office, and finally succeeded in bringing about the reformation of the woman, little knowing her identity. She adopted the child and secured work for Anna as a nurse. Later, Anna, now on her upward path, stepped into a church in search of spiritual consolation. There, face to face, she met Bob, praying at the foot of a cross. There, for the first time, Bob learned that he was the father of Anna's child--a frightful revelation that spelled the day of death for the gentle-hearted priest. One afternoon Mrs. Carroll, Bob, and the child went for an auto ride. They ran down Jim Whitcomb as he staggered from a saloon. At the hospital, there was a moment of recognition and understanding--a moment of horror during which Mrs. Carroll understood that her adapted child was really her grand-child: Anna, that this good woman benefactor was the mother of Bob; Bob, that he had kept in his own home as his mother's ward, his own child--and all of them knew that the end of Jim Whitcomb had come. Falling at his feet, Father Bob whispered, \"Forgive me, for I knew not what I did.\" In his study the next day they found Father Bob, sitting upright in his chair, tightly clutching the big crucifix on his desk, his glassy eyes fastened on the Savior. Bending over him, Mrs. Carrol and Anna heard his stiffened lips mutter: \"Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give thee rest.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"12 Aug 1912","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Battleground","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Omer F.

Beatrice sees his predicament and descends from Paradise into Limbo, where she asks the poet Virgil to rescue and guide Dante. Virgil knows another way to go, but this leads straight through the entire Inferno, before it continues towards Paradise. Virgil leads Dante to the portals of Inferno. Charon ferries them over the river Acheron, and then they start their journey downwards through the different circles of Inferno. Dante meets all kind of sinners and sees the never-ending punishments they have to undergo. The various punishments are adjusted to the different transgressions. Among the sinners Dante recognizes many persons he has met in Florence, when they were still alive. They tell him their sad stories and why they have ended here. At last Dante and Virgil meets the arch traitor Lucifer, who holds the bodies of Brutus and Cassius in his mouth. The two poets climb down the shaggy sides of Lucifer, to reach the subterranean way which leads out of Inferno.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Francesco Bertolini, Adolfo Padovan, Giuseppe de Liguoro","Released":"01 Jul 1911","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"68 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"349","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Italy","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Dante's Inferno","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"26 Oct 2004","Writer":"Dante Alighieri (poem)","Production":"N/A","Language":"Italian","tomatoUserMeter":"83"}

The hot blooded gypsy snake tamer is passionately in love with the attractive young man, hut he does not quite return her feelings. She is hasty and ill-tempered, and not far from being cruel to those depending on her. For the first time the Flying Circus pitches its tents in a small country town. The daughter of the mayor attends. The rope dancer meets her and for him it is a case of love at first sight, and he decides to do all in his power to win her. That night a great fire breaks out in the town, and the flying embers ignite the home of the mayor. The townspeople strive to deflect the flames, but all in vain. The mansion is doomed to destruction and it seems that the mayor's daughter must perish. At this juncture Laurento beats his way through the flames and scales the wall, and, picking up the frantic maiden, jumps to the mesh of telegraph wires outside the window. Carrying his burden over the fragile wires, he saves her amid the frantic cheers of the populace. The grateful mayor makes him a welcome guest, and he soon wins the heart of the young girl, but he has yet to obtain the father's consent. He worries continually about this problem, and not even at home can he rest in peace, for Ula Kiri, who feels that her beloved friend is sliding away from her, keeps tormenting him with jealousy and mockery. At last he plucks up his courage and goes to the mayor. The latter is friendly to the young man, but he compels the rope dancer to leave with a vague promise for the future. If circumstances, should alter. A capital idea strikes the young man to obtain money. He arranges to do a rope dance to the church tower. The circus director is delighted with the idea. The great day arrives, and the people of the town gather around the church. The rope dancer cannot forget Erna's sorrowful eyes and pale face as he walks along the flaccid rope towards the dizzy height. A snake has escaped and its body bars the way to the entrance to the tower. The snake tamer has, in her mad jealousy, forgotten all about her duties, and this negligence now proves fatal. Erna implores her in vain to call back the reptile, as she is the only one that can do it, but Ula Kiri will not listen to her in her storm of jealousy and hatred. But Erna overcomes all difficulties. Her great love teaches her what to do, and thus she saves her sweetheart. The mayor can no longer withhold his consent to the marriage and the same evening the Flying Circus goes away to the other regions, leaving a happy couple in the country town.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Alfred Lind","Released":"28 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"46 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Denmark","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Flying Circus","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Carl Otto Dumreicher, Alfred Lind","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Muller is fond of horses and rides his own horse in the steeplechase, a big society event. His horse falls and Muller is fatally injured. On his death bed he tells his secret and implores his parents to care for his wife and little boy. They are taken into the family, but incur the displeasure of Muller's brother-in-law, who sees in the lad a possible claimant for his grandfather's fortune, which the brother-in-law hopes to inherit. He offers Muller's widow some money if she will go away with the boy. She spurns this but leaves with her son and tries to make a living by sewing. She does not succeed and finally yields to the proposal of her son's grandmother that she will adopt the boy, but cannot receive his mother. Some time afterward seeing her son in the park with his nurse, she seizes him and jumps in the lake, intending to end both their lives, but they are rescued by some men. For this act the mother is sentenced to a long term in prison. When she gets out she is old, and her son, now grown op, is a military cadet, still living with his grandparents who are very proud of him. His old mother gets employment as a scrub woman, but is soon discharged for incompetency and she wanders about in search of work. Her son comes across her as she lays fainting in the road, while some boys are ridiculing her. He drives them off and carries her home, where he finds out that she is his mother.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"N/A","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Victor Sjöström","Released":"01 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Sweden","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Ruined Life","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"Swedish","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

A large man enters his flat; a mosquito in top hat with valise follows, entering through the window above door. The man goes to sleep; the mosquito lands next to him, opens the valise, and takes out a grinding wheel to sharpen his proboscis. Methodically, the mosquito gets one, two, then three drinks as the man tosses, slaps, turns, covers himself, and rubs the wounds. After a fourth drink, the mosquito is so full he can barely right himself. Still he has more. Bloated, he can only hover above the sleeping man's face. Suspense builds: can he launch? He's atop his victim's nose. He jettisons his valise.

The widow's son has a locket containing a photograph of his mother, which the gambler wishes to have, but as the boy is unwilling to sell it to him, Hughes leaves and writes a proposal to the widow. Her refusal incites him to indulge in drink more freely, until he is soon reduced to a derelict. Ten years later, while walking up a street in a western town, he asks the widow's son (whom he does not recognize) for a few pennies. In pulling out the money from his pockets the locket drops and a mutual recognition follows. Hughes steers the boy into a saloon, where he loses the money with which he was to pay the ranch help. The boy tells his mother and sweetheart of his wrong doing and leaves the house, determined to shoot himself. Just as he is leveling the pistol to his temple Hughes, who has won back the boy's money, stays his hand and gives him the amount he had lost. Hurrying to his home the boy tells his mother and sweetheart the joyful news, while the old gambler looks in the window once more upon the face of the woman he loves and then passes out of her life forever.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"11 Jan 1912","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Locket","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Allan Dwan","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Bill is a sailor at the London docks and is a very steady young fellow. Bob, on the other hand, is not nearly so steady, but makes a lot of money betting on horses. In this way, by helping him rake in several good pots. Bob curries favor with old man Rogers, who promises him that he shall wed his daughter, 'Arriet. They are married in great style and look regular toffs on their wedding day, driving down Whitechapel in grand style. Bill is abroad in his ship and does not hear of the wedding until long afterwards. Luck is fickle and soon turns against Bob 'Armon, who loses not only all his own money, but all the savings of his father-in-law. Then he takes to drinking heavily and badly ill-treats his wife, who is about to present him with an heir. His drunken and thriftless habits are such that old man Rogers soon dies of a broken heart, leaving 'Arriet in the sole care of her now utterly brutal husband. Even after the birth of 'Arriet's baby, Bob continues his downward career. After a drunken row in a public house, in which he severely wounds a pot companion, he is obliged to flee the country and leaves his wife utterly penniless. 'Arriet has now no means of supporting herself and the baby and is reduced to such straits that she is obliged to beg in the streets, to save herself from starvation. One day, when soliciting alms in a public house, she meets Bill Larkin, who has just returned from a long voyage. She recognizes him, but so weak has she become from lack of food, that she is unable to bear the shock and sinks to the floor in a swoon. Bill has her carried to her home and sends for a doctor. It is too late, however, for starvation has so shattered her health that she dies the next day, after receiving Bill's promise that he will care for her child as if she were his own. Bill faithfully fulfills his vow for the sake of the little woman he so dearly loved,","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Van Dyke Brooke","Released":"21 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"'Arriet's Baby","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

John Brown, his wife, two sons, Harold and Billy, and a young sister named Helen, has settled on an isolated plantation in the Jungles. Jack Arden, son of another English planter, who comes over frequently to hunt with the boys has fallen in love with Helen. But Papa Brown discourages the lovers, saying that Helen is too young to be married. Jack agrees to wait. Some time afterward the Browns receive a letter from Jack stating that he is coming for another week-end of shooting- with the Brown boys. On his way to the Brown's home, Jack knocks down Concho, an overseer, for being cruel to one of the slaves. His action is approved of by the Browns. In honor of Jack the family starts on a lion hunt, and, after a long trip, they return by the river route. They espy a lioness drinking at the river's edge. She is killed by Jack and taken aboard. That night Jack again asks Mr. Brown for Helen's hand and is again told to wait. The next day when Jack is going away, Helen, unknown to anyone else, accompanies him a little way into the jungle. Concho sees this and follows, until he sees them part. On the way home Helen dismounts and starts to pick some wild flowers until her attention is attracted by a lion cub. She ties her horse to a tree and trails the cub. She is followed and accosted by Concho. At the moment when she seems to be at the complete mercy of this half-breed brute, a leopard leaps from the undergrowth and attacks the villainous overseer. While the half-breed fights desperately with the ferocious beast. Helen makes her escape. She manages to make her way back to the spot where she left her horse, but, discovers a huge lion devouring the mangled remains of her mount. Terror-stricken she runs aimlessly into the jungle where she is soon followed by the lion and its mate. Concho, in the meantime, has managed to escape from the leopard. He crawls back to the plantation and accounts for his wounds by maliciously declaring that Jack Arden had abducted Helen and made off with her. Brown and boys start off in pursuit of the alleged kidnapper. The posse overtakes Jack only to discover they have been tricked by the malicious half-breed. The mystery of Helen's disappearance is still unsolved and Jack, beside himself with lover's grief, returns with the party to organize a searching expedition. In the meantime Helen has been chased to the banks of a river by the frenzied lions. In her fright she falls from a cliff into the stream below. She swims through the turbulent waters to the opposite bank and once more rushes into the dense brush. The maddened lions follow her through the water toward the opposite shore. The searching party is coming down the river at this time on rafts. Jack Arden's raft rounds a bend in the stream just in time for him to see the lions plunge into a thicket. Simultaneously he hears a scream and realizes that it emanates from Helen who lies at the mercy of the beasts. His rifle springs to his shoulder and two shots ring forth.

His sweetheart, Madge, often visited him while at work in the mountains, but never completely sympathized with his work. She wanted his whole love and attention. Bill Hogan was much beloved by pretty Carrie, but he, being also in love with Madge, ignored her. Bill felt that Jim's ability to paint was what had won Madge's heart. In a cozy part of the canyon lived charming Pauline, commonly called \"The Angel of the Canyon,\" because of her many good deeds for the villagers. One morning she saw the artist at work with pretty Madge gazing petulantly at his canvas. She saw them quarrel, Madge fly toward the house, and Jim turn angrily toward his work. Then she stepped close beside him and he, thinking it Madge, took up her hand and kissed it, without looking up from his work. Even an angel can have human feeling, and the angel in this case found a special delight in the unexpected kiss. When Jim, in confusion, apologized, it seemed a desecration. But Madge, watching from a distance, thought otherwise. Several days later the angel, walking in the direction of the artist's glen, found and took away his canvas. Three weeks later he called upon her and found a check for $100 awaiting him and a brand new box for his equipment. Delighted, he showed his treasures to Madge, who only pouted and then cried. Meanwhile, Bill Hogan nursed a grudge in secret. A day came when the angel, strolling through the woods, saw a terrible fist fight between Bill Hogan and Jim. Beside them stood Madge and Carrie, vainly trying to separate then. Then came the angel's moment of renunciation. She had grown to love him and had to fight herself to repress the desire to go away. But her better nature conquered. She separated the combatants, gave Jim to Madge and pacified the troubled Bill. She strolled with Bill into the forest and when she returned, he went willingly to the happy Carrie.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"12 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Angel of the Canyons","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Austin merely left his wife sitting alone; he made no effort to introduce her and showed his neglect plainly to the guests about the club grounds. Austin, on the links, tiring of the game, met Jennie Wilton, a widow. They strolled throughout the grounds together and the wife of Austin grieved in her heart at the sight. Her mother, proud of the splendid match her ingenuity had made, watched proceedings carefully, drinking her wine on the great balcony and ever keeping an eye out for trouble. It came when Jack Stanton, bachelor, made a spectacular drive. The ball rolled three hundred yards away and stopped at the feet of the lonesome wife. Acquaintance ripened into friendship in an hour. Returning, after a stroll with the Wilton woman, Austin saw his wife talking with Stanton. Instantly there was a clash. Austin turned upon his wife and the dislike of years focused in a bitter speech. He went away after that with the Wilton girl and his lonesome wife, sitting alone, watched through a glass while Austin kissed her in a boat gliding through the tress toward the open lake. A few minutes later Austin made up his mind. Pulling in toward shore, he wrote a note and sent a boy to deliver it to his wife. Stanton, seeing it all, took the note from the servant, and himself carried it to the mother of Mrs. Austin. She read it, smiled, gazed out to sea and turned happily toward Jack Stanton.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"06 Jan 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Another Man's Wife","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

If they do not pay up promptly she is the one who goes to their place of employment and \"bawls them out.\" Young Dick Lewis, a bank clerk, to help his fellow clerk. Jack Gray, borrows $200 of Charker & Co. The bawlerout is sent to his home to find out all about him. She pretends to be a book agent and talks with his mother, a kindly old gentlewoman. Satisfied that the boy is all he said, Charker & Co., advance him the money. Dick is engaged to Edith Downs, the pretty daughter of the bank cashier. She is a selfish, heartless girl, caring more for dress than she does for anything else. When Dick, owing to the fact that he has no evening clothes, finds himself unable to go to a ball with her, she calls his rival on the 'phone and makes an appointment to go with him, Dick's friend refuses to help Dick pay back the money he borrowed for his sake; so the bawlerout is sent to the bank to disgrace the boy. But as she begins she sees his mother entering with the bank president. The sight of the gentle old lady softens the girl and she goes away without accomplishing her purpose. John Howard, a reformer, disguises as a workman to find out the truth about the loan shark establishment. He interests the bawlerout and together they find out that President Bendis of the bank in which Dick is employed is the real head of Charker & Co. Edith's father, to keep up with his daughter's extravagance, borrows money from the bank which he is unable to repay. The girl, learning of this and dreading to see her father disgraced, suggests that as Dick loves her, he take the blame. The boy agrees. Miss Sullivan, who has become friendly with Dick's mother, is a constant visitor at the house. But she has never permitted herself to soften toward Dick, who, despite this and the fact of his engagement to Edith, falls in love with the erstwhile bawlerout. Howard and Miss Sullivan secure the necessary evidence against Charker's. In the bank the money is missed and Dick accused. He says nothing and is about to be arrested when Howard enters with the bawlerout. Bendis is told that he is wanted by the police and Miss Sullivan, seeing Dick handcuffed, asks the reason and is told. One glance from the boy to the shrinking cashier convinces her as to just who the thief is. She \"bawls out\" Downs and breaks him so that he readily confesses. As he and Bendis are taken away, Edith turns to Dick and informs him that she is done with him, she has become engaged to the other man. With a great sigh of relief, Dick holds out his arms to Miss Sullivan, and she, despite her past coldness, enters his embrace. And it is thus that Dick's mother finds them a little later.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Oscar Apfel","Released":"30 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Bawlerout","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Forrest Halsey (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Morgan offers to throw the Aqueduct Contract in his way if he will influence his young daughter, Nell, to marry him. Bascom agrees, but later finds that Nell has engaged herself to Dick, a young reporter, and will have nothing to do with the boss. Morgan, furious, tells Bascom that now he will be ruined, indeed. By accident, Dick wanders into an East Side saloon where, in a private room, the boss meets his constituents. Dick overhears Morgan telling Hart, contractor, to meet him in the saloon at nine sharp as he is going to open all bids submitted so that Hart may make his lower than the others. Dick rushes back to his editor and tells him that he can secure a great graft story, but how. They hit upon the dictagraph. Dick plants it in the saloon and that night at nine is busy in a little upstairs room with the receiver at his ear busily jotting down notes. Nell is with him. The bids are brought to the boss by the commissioner's clerk, one of his henchmen. Bascom's bid is discovered to be the lowest of all and just as Hart is about to reduce his, the dictagraph wires are discovered and the boss dashes upstairs. Jumping upon Dick, he almost kills him when Bascom enters and saves the young chap's life. He takes the two young folks home and Dick is preparing his article for the press when the boss, who has experienced a change of heart, enters and tells Bascom that his bid will get the contract. Nell thanks him and Dick, for her sake flings his \"graft scandal\" story into the fire.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Frederick Sullivan","Released":"14 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Big Boss","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Lu Senarens","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Hamilton takes pathetic leave of his daughter, Edna, and his young son, James, and goes to the front to fight for the Southern cause. The opposing armies are seen in thrilling battles. One day Capt. Blake receives orders to go on a foraging expedition, and arrives at the Hamilton home. The soldiers make short work of the chicken coop, Don, little Jimmie's pet horse, is taken. The old Negro servant puts up a stubborn fight to save his young master's pet, but is knocked down by a soldier. Further punishment Is prevented by Capt. Blake, who arrives upon the scene. Jimmie rushes to the captain and begs and pleads for his horse. The tenderhearted young officer is touched by the tears and grief of the boy, and finally gives him back the animal. Edna sees Capt. Blake about to take a drink at the well and, nerved by her hatred of the North, rushes out and dashes the shell from his hands. Amused by the little spitfire, Blake solemnly bows and says: \"In the North our men are gentlemen, and the women, ladies,\" and walks away, Edna, ashamed of her conduct, battles with her emotions for a few moments, and calls the Captain back, offering him a drink with her own fair hands. After his departure, Edna learns of his kindness in saving Jimmie's horse, and the captain did not suspect the impression he had made on her heart. Some time later the Union Army is in desperate straits, being attacked by a heavy force. The troops tight against tremendous odds, refusing to surrender, and Capt. Blake volunteers to pierce the enemy's lines and deliver a message to the Union general commanding the other wing to come to the rescue by consolidating the forces. Blake makes a thrilling ride, pursued by Confederate soldiers, who shoot his horse and wound him. Weak and staggering, he finds himself near the Hamilton home and drags himself to the door, Edna and Jimmie do everything in their power to make him comfortable, and he is saved from capture by a clever trick, blacking his face and hands and putting him in the Negro quarters. The pursuing soldiers are told by old Mammy that he is her son who has been shot by the man they are searching for. The booming cannon in the distance greatly distress Blake, who realizes the predicament of his comrades. In desperation, he asks Jimmie to do him a favor and makes him promise on his word of honor not to tell any one. The grateful boy is staggered by the request Jim makes, of riding to the Northern general with the message, and refuses at first, but in splendid dissolving scenes visions of his pet being restored to him are seen, and he agrees. The boy makes a daring ride, and the Union forces are saved. The Confederates are driven back through the town, and Col. Hamilton, to save himself from capture runs into the Negro cabin, where he is astounded to find his daughter and a Northern officer. In an instant his gun is in his hand, but he is stopped by Edna, who explains the situation. The pursuing Northern soldiers arrive at the door and Blake hides Hamilton behind the bed, and informs the soldiers that no one is there. He rejoins his command, and rides away. After the war is over Blake comes back to the Hamilton home and is joyfully received by Edna.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Thomas H.

Through the persuasions of a friend, Hal begins to frequent a questionable pool room. His brother, Paul, a cleric, warns him against his evil associates, but Hal disregards Paul's counsels. In a short time he begins to play for money. He gets into a game with a young man, who unknown to him, is a notorious counterfeiter, one of a gang whose headquarters are under the pool room, and of which the pool room proprietor is a member. In settling the stakes, Hal is handed a couple of crisp new bills. One of these he unwittedly passes on a local merchant. In the meantime, a detective has been on the trail of the counterfeiters and has begun to suspect Hal. When the merchant shows him the \"queer\" and describes the man who \"shoved\" it on him, the detective begins a search for Hal. The latter is warned by a pal and goes to his brother Paul for counsel. Paul persuades Hal to let him (Paul) takes Hal's place. Accordingly, the brothers (who are twins) exchange vestures. Hal donning Paul's clerical raiment and Paul assuming his brother's layman's attire. The detective arrives and arrests Paul, who is subsequently convicted and committed to prison, while Hal attempts to carry on his brother's work. In the course of his itinerant preaching he strikes upon a clue which leads to the discovery and capture of the counterfeiters. In the gun play which takes place between the police and the criminals, the young counterfeiter is fatally wounded. Hal persuades him to confess. Paul is now pardoned and resumes his missionary work. The closing scenes show Paul preaching to a crowd, with Hal and his family in attendance.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Theodore Wharton","Released":"20 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Brother's Loyalty","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

She had read many books and from them had gained the idea that she would be far happier as a simple peasant than as the daughter of a king. Even when it came to her marriage, she sadly reflected, there was no romance, for her father had arbitrarily contracted an alliance for her with a neighboring prince. The princess was taking her drive one day and was sadder than ever. She saw a wedding procession issue from a neighboring cottage, and pityingly watched the mother of the bride, as she turned into her lonely house. In a field the princess noticed a young farmer, and she thought that the romance which had been denied her might come into her life. By the time she had returned to the castle she was pitying herself exceedingly, and had decided to be a caged bird no longer. The princess secured a peasant's gown, and, well supplied with money, stole away from the palace, as she thought, forever. Before going she opened the cage of her pet canary and watched him fly away happy at his new found liberty. In the life outside the castle the princess found she was handicapped by her ignorance. She gave alms to a crippled man, and he scandalized the community by spending it in riotous living. She met the young farmer and he horrified her by roughly kissing her. She procured a home with the mother of the bride and her money was stolen by that depraved old woman. Disillusioned, the princess returned to her castle. Just outside its gates she came upon the little bird she had set at liberty. It, too, had found itself unfitted for an adventurous life. Strange, fierce birds bad attacked it, and the little canary was feebly trying to return to the castle, when its mistress came along. The bird was glad to be placed in its gilded cage again. The princess was glad to return to her old life, marry, the prince, who was really a very decent young chap, and retain the place which her birth and breeding entitled her to fill.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"06 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Caged Bird","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Three miles away Rattlesnake Pete, by way of diversion, soundly and thoroughly beat Mrs. Rattlesnake Pete and took away his ferocious pal to the cache where the stolen money was hidden. Simultaneously, the sheriff posted up a $500 reward notice for the same pair and aroused the cupidity of \"Know-it-All Jones,\" who, revolver in hand, went in search of that five hundred. Now it fell out that Calamity, seeing the notice, also needed cash; so when a suspicious character appeared, hiked him toward the sheriff at the point of her gun. Alas! The sheriff dismissed her with the remark that a harmless old tramp was a poor excuse. So Calamity, in disgust left. Later she fell upon the real bandit and so knocked the wind out of the husky body of Rattlesnake Pete that the desperado in panic fled down the road. His Pal also fled straight into the arms of Know-It-All Jones, who promptly helped him along toward the sheriff. Then Calamity, overhauling her victim again fell upon him with such frightful effect that the poor wretch fled straight into the sheriff's arms for protection. And then, horror of horrors, the sheriff refused the reward on the ground that the bandit had given himself up - and, to make matters worse, Calamity beheld \"Know-It-All Jones\" collect his change and depart. Heart-sick Calamity left and shortly after with only Calamity's luck, fell straight upon the cache wherein was hidden the dough. With this Calamity, in righteous indignation, decided to vamoose, but on the way, leading her burro, came upon the house of Rattlesnake Pete and there saw his weeping and poverty-stricken wife. Calamity's tender heart gave way. She hauled the bags of dust from her bosom and presented them to the unfortunate wife, leaving, with a light heart and a heavy laden burro, for parts unknown.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"10 Mar 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Calamity Anne, Detective","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Jim saw much of Mabel and Mabel's faith in Bob waned in proportion as she grew to love Jim. A day came when the boys caught Bob. They were treating him roughly when Jim interfered and bid them leave Bob alone. They left and Mabel came. Bob, who had thought Jim dead, was so overcome as to offer his hand. For reply Jim stooped, picked up another brick and handed it to him with a look at Mabel, saying, \"Hit me again, Bob, and maybe she'll marry me.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"07 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Cupid Throws a Brick","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Tom blew in his little stake before leaving, and arrived out West broke and discouraged. There he fell in with two crooks and with them laid plans to hold up the pay wagon of the construction camp. Meanwhile, a hobo got off a freight and strolled to the camp in search of work. He needed only a chance to reform. He watched the men place a stick of dynamite and leave, and too late, saw Tom, crouched down in the danger zone, gun in hand, waiting for the pay wagon. There was a terrific explosion and Tom died. Hurrying to the scene, the hobo donned Tom's clothes and papers, secured work, took Tom's name and prospered. Worrying over the absence of her intended, Mabel and her father visited the construction camp. They asked for Tom and his namesake, now clean shaven, handsome and prosperous-looking, responded. There were explanations and a visit to the grave. \"With him I buried my failures,\" said the other. In the days that followed, Mabel found she still wanted the name of Tom, and eventually married him.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace Reid","Released":"28 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Dead Man's Shoes","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Wallace Reid","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Several times Jack Hardy almost reaches the proposal point with Marion Van Sickles, but each time the fates are against him. Marion and her mother are on their way home from a vacation in Europe and board the boat at Liverpool at the same time as Jack, who is very much struck by Marion's appearance. After a little flirtation on the boat, he believes that his feelings are returned and is about to propose. Just then mama comes along with Count Brainlesse, whom she wishes to marry Marion. The proposal is postponed. Again and again Jack tries to come to the point, being constantly interrupted by someone, either the count or mama, or the grouchy owner of the deck chair he has taken. First the grouch, then mama, and then the count, get sea-sick and at last Jack has Marion alone. Alas, the time has not yet come. Jack himself is suddenly seized with sickness and has to rush away just as the words tremble on his lips. The remainder of the voyage is spent by Jack in his bunk, from which he is too ill to rise. The steamer docks early in the morning before the steward has visited him and he does not wake himself until everyone is ready to leave the ship's side. He rushes to the deck, clad in nothing but his pajamas, Marion is with the count and her mother is nearby. It is obvious that the count is proposing marriage, but before he can place the ring on Marion's finger, Jack pushes in front of him, and falling on his knees, proposes to her in full view of everyone on deck. Marion joyfully goes to his arms and together they turn to pacify her scandalized mother and make the necessary explanations to the onlookers.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"James Young","Released":"20 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Delayed Proposals","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"L.

The high-spirited girl repulses him as equally unworthy of love or respect, but temporizes with him. About this time Captain Falconbridge, of the U. S. Cavalry, who is stationed at the Mexican border, is introduced to Irma at Don Arguello's home by Don Carlos, a high-grade young Mexican, who consorts with Americans. At a later visit Don Arguello happens on the scene and shows his immediate disapproval by insulting the American flag which Falconbridge has presented to Irma. This so incenses the soldier that he requests the ladies to leave the room while he gives the old roué a sound trouncing. He has completed this in satisfactory fashion, the furniture being wrecked in the struggle, when a detachment of Mexican soldiers arrive. Falconbridge escapes the vengeance of the reinforcements by leaping through a window. Irma, who is waiting the outcome of the fight in the garden, decides to fly over the border with the American and escape her vengeful and despised guardian. Don Carlos admires Irma, but unselfishly gives aid to this good cause. Close to the border the fleeing pair are forced to take refuge in an adobe. There they \"stand off\" the pursuing greasers until the boys of Falconbridge's command, hearing the firing, and scenting trouble, ride over the border and make a daring rescue.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"E.A.

Morey, Anita Stewart, Florence Ashbrooke, George Randolph","Plot":"While staying at the house of Mr. and Mrs. Moore, some old friends, Mr. and Mrs. Burton receive invitations to a dance. The evening of the dance, Mrs. Moore tells them that she and her husband will be away for the night, staying at her mother's, and gives the key to Mrs. Burton so that she and her husband will have no trouble getting into the house when they return. As soon as the Moores and Burtons have driven away to keep their respective engagements, Maggie, the cook, also leaves the house; she is going to a wedding celebration and expects to be away all night and to return in the morning before her master and mistress get back. She tells the sleepy housemaid, Bridget, that she has the key in her pocket-book. When the Burtons get back from the dance they find that they have left the key behind. They ring and ring, but Bridget, who is a fat, sleepy individual, does not hear them. An attempt to enter the house by means of the cellar is futile. Burton does not have much trouble getting through the cellar window but is unable to get through the door that leads into the kitchen, as it is locked. He succeeds, however, in knocking over an ash barrel and getting his clothes badly messed. The Burtons then attempt to rouse the maid by telephoning to the house, but she still sleeps soundly and does not hear them. Incidentally it costs two dollars to appease the sleepy druggist for bringing him out of bed. They next decide to go to a hotel, but the clerk will not admit them as they have no baggage. The rest of the night they spend in a taxi-cab as it is too chilly to walk about the streets. About eight o'clock in the morning, Maggie returns from the wedding party and sees the taxi in front of the house. Maggie looks inside, and seeing the sleepers, becomes alarmed and shrieks out that they are dead. Her screams awake Mr. and Mrs. Burton, who joyfully recognize her and get the key at last. Not the least of their troubles is that the taxi meter has been piling up the bill steadily and Burton finds that he has about seventeen dollars to pay for what has been, at the best, an uncomfortable lodging house.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Ralph Ince","Released":"07 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Forgotten Latchkey","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Mrs. Victor Koch","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

They fall asleep and dream of their past life. Their dreams carry them from boy and girlhood all through life to this day, greatest of all, their golden wedding. Their first meeting shows them, at the age of five, on their way to school, and even then, as young as they are, the seed of love is sown. A few years and we see them growing past the school age. Next we see the youth proposing and being accepted: the happiest moment of their lives, their first-born baby. War between the North and South breaks out and the youth is called to fight for his side, the South. As he goes away he puts the picture of his wife in his pocket next to his heart. Daily letters are written from the front telling of the war and the little wife anxiously waits for the next one to come, but one day none arrives, then another day. Something must be wrong. At the front the boy is wounded, and if it had not been for the tintype in his pocket, the bullet would have killed him instead of glancing off, only causing a broken arm. Home he comes to rest and to wait for his arm to heal. Happiness reigns once more in the little home. War is over and they live the quiet happy lives of country folk till we meet them again, asleep at the fireplace. His pipe drops. He awakens. It is time to go to bed. He lights the candle and the good wife calls in the cat and both, arm in arm, go upstairs to dream the dreams of their youth again.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Herbert Prior","Released":"09 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Golden Wedding","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

His disapproval is so marked that it is finally noticed by said swain, Tim Brown, when he is kicked out of the house by the father of his lady love, and he resolves to be careful in the future and not be subjected to further indignities. The Professor has been experimenting with germs, and discovers some new and deadly ones which he exhibits to some of his medical friends. The germs have been raised in a culture of milk, and when the professor escorts his guests to the door the milk bottle and the cup are left on the table. Unfortunately, Tim Brown seized this particular moment to make a call on his lady love, accompanied by his dog, making his entrance through an open window. The dog is thirsty, so he innocently pours more milk into the cup and gives it to the animal. The professor, returning, sees what is taking place, and crying, \"The dog is full of deadly germs,\" runs away. The dog, attracted by the queerly acting, screaming man, runs after him, and soon there is tremendous excitement, half the town running with the Professor, and the others running after him and the dog. After many narrow escapes from the deadly teeth of the dog, the professor finally reaches a place of safety.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Henry Lehrman","Released":"05 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Help!

That is to say Bessie loved an idol, a very perishable clay idol much addicted to the use of liquor. Shortly after their marriage, Bob came home reeling drunk. Bessie tried in vain to break him but, with the further use of the poison, Bob fell into evil ways, returned home but seldom and then only to maltreat and abuse her. A day came when Bessie could no longer stand the strain; so she packed her small belongings and dolefully went forth to seek new joys in new fields. Bob, coming home quite drunk, found the house locked and drifted away with the oddities of Fate. Tired, Bessie sat down upon a rock. Will Wayne, riding slowly down the road saw her, stopped and hearing her story took her home. Old man Wayne and Will's mother kept her for several weeks and Will grew to love her dearly. But independent Bessie though the time had come to leave and was only dissuaded by the urgent request of the whole family. Two years later, Bessie found the morning paper on the stoop. Its first page contained a story of a railroad wreck and among the slain was Bob. A year later Bessie married Will and the young couple moved to Will's new home and were happy. Riding through the mountains one day, Will came upon Bob Evans, very much alive, quite sick and quite dirty. Not knowing him he took him home. Between Bob and Bessie there was instant trouble. Will started to interfere and a scuffle followed. Will dropped dead with a bullet through him. The cowboys then found the slayer creeping through hills and ended a career that had wrecked the life and happiness of Bessie.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace Reid","Released":"19 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Her Innocent Marriage","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Theodosia Harris (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Bunny's prejudice is simply against widows in general, as he has not met the lady in question, but none the less, he quite means what he says. Fred confides with his chum, Joe Tripp, and together they plan to put one over on the obstinate old gentleman. Tripp invites a crowd of people to a week-end party, among them John Bunny, and, unknown to him, also the widow. Bunny and the widow are thrown together, but he does not seem very susceptible to her charms. He is tired and sleepy and would much prefer taking a nap to talking with the most charming lady in existence. After a while, he gets away from her and tries to snatch forty winks in the conservatory. It is no use, the young folks soon drive him out of there. He tries the drawing-room and is again obliged to decamp. At last, in desperation, he goes upstairs, and entering the first bedroom he reaches, which happens to be the widow's, he throws himself down and at once enters the land of nod. Seeing him when she enters the room, the widow rushes off in consternation and calls to Fred and Joe to turn him out. An idea strikes them. Waking Uncle John they tell him that he has compromised himself and must at once marry the lady. Bunny is very much disturbed, but cheers up considerably when his nephew offers to take his place and so save him from a disagreeable situation. Hastily giving Fred and the widow his heartfelt blessings, he rushes away, to everyone's amusement, and resumes once more his interrupted slumbers.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wilfrid North","Released":"12 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"His Tired Uncle","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Henry Kaige","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

She decides to go out for a walk in the hope that something in the way of an adventure may come her way. Fred Hanley, a young man, has become a confirmed drunkard. A friend of his brings a doctor to visit Hanley. Hanley becomes excited during their visit and frightens them nearly unto death by shooting at them with a revolver. They leave in haste, but decide to lock Hanley in his room. This they do, leaving a servant to watch the door. Hanley, crazed for want of drink, writes a note that he is wrongfully imprisoned, and offers $5,000 reward for anyone who liberates him. This he throws out the window, just as Pearl is passing the house. She picks it up, reads it and realizes that her quest for an adventure has borne fruit. She immediately goes home and disguises as a boy. Coming back, she applies for a job and the woman downstairs employs her and puts the supposed boy to work. Pearl has a hard time of it, peeling potatoes and scrubbing floors, but with never a chance to liberate the unfortunate, supposed prisoner. Later, however, she is caught upstairs listening at the door by the servant, and is kicked downstairs.

General excitement prevailed in Jayville Center. Newspaper rumors had it that right there in Jayville, counterfeiters were at work on spurious coin. Impossible! The only one in the town who believed this was Hank, and he kept a close lookout for suspicious characters. Hank happened across Willie and often made Willie mad. Willie proved this more than once with his left foot. In Hank's mind, suspicion pointed her index finger in the direction of Willie. When Willie was eloping with Katy, Hank hurried to the sheriff and informed him of his daughter's flight with a counterfeiter. The sheriff and a posse pursued. The elopers sought refuge in a deserted house, which proved to be the real counterfeiters' den. There was a real fight, and a tie up in the wedding business for a while, but Willie won out. The sheriff and his posse arrived. In the glory of his capture of the counterfeiters the sheriff was won over by Willie.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Will S.
