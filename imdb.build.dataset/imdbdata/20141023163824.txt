Calvert, Allen Holubar, William Bailey, Dorothy Phillips","Plot":"The story opens in a bank in Minneapolis. Fred Wentworth, one of the clerks, is sent out on a message, and while he is gone the cashier is shot dead by Frank Davis, a robber and bad man generally. Davis secures a package of bank notes and hurriedly departs. On his way to the street he runs into Fred Wentworth (who is returning to the bank) with such force that he drops the package. He recognizes Wentworth and, fearful of arrest, rushes away and catches a northbound train that is just pulling out. Wentworth stops amazed and lifts the package. Entering the bank, he discovers the dead cashier and a revolver on the floor. Horrified, he lifts the revolver, and while holding it and the package of bills in his hands the president of the bank enters. The proofs of murder are so clear that Wentworth is sentenced to life imprisonment in the penitentiary. Frank Davis, in the meantime, has gone to one of his old haunts in the North, near the boundary line. He induces one of his former associates to join him in whiskey-running across the border. While the men are engaged in this outlawry, Fred Wentworth escapes from prison and heads for the Northwest. He is saved from death in the snowdrifts by an officer of the mounted police, who carries him to headquarters. After his recovery he applies to the chief for admission to the force, and is accepted as a member. The president of the Minneapolis bank, a brother of the chief of the N. W. M. P., chances to arrive at the post on a visit about, the time that Wentworth is about to leave on a search for the whiskey smugglers. The president catches a side glimpse of Wentworth's face as he rides off, and tries to recall it. He fails, but it still haunts him, and the truth flashes on him some time after Wentworth's departure. He immediately denounces Wentworth as an escaped murderer, and the chief dispatches two of his men to arrest that officer. Wentworth, in the interim, has discovered the smugglers, and is badly worsted in an encounter with Davis, whom he recognizes as the murderer of the cashier. The two officers arrive at the spot shortly after the struggle, and Davis opens fire on them. They mortally wound him and he is carried into the cabin, where they arrest Wentworth. Davis, after confessing that he killed the cashier, and that Wentworth is innocent, dies. Wentworth is taken back to the post and is cleared of the crime in presence of the chief and his brother. He is then restored to his former position in the Minneapolis bank.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Theodore Wharton","Released":"19 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Into the North","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Theodore Wharton (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Pretty Claudine often went forth to visit the traps with him and one day, when no bound, they saw a youth kiss a maiden affectionately. Seeing a chance for an object lesson, the old trapper sagely shook his head, saying, \"My child, such kisses are poison. Guard against them.\" Claudine had a herd of goats which she tends carefully, and one say, sitting one a rock with them scampering about her, she made so pretty a picture that Ralph Walters, a young artist from the city, asked her to pose for him. They arranged an engagement for the following day. He posed her prettily and then, overcome by her beauty, impulsively kissed her upturned, inquiring lips. Claudine fled in shame. From a distance she watched him, debating her father's advice. Then, plucking a handful of poisoned berries, she went again to him. He ate them gladly. In a few moments he fell, deathly sick, across the rock and Claudine ran, badly scared to her father. Together they rescued the sick artist, and took him home. He recovered, and one day, while away with her father, she told him her reason for giving him the poisoned berries. Furious at the insult offered his daughter, the aged trapper hurried back, gave Ralph a gun, and offered him a chance for his life. Overcome by feeling, Claudine stepped in between them and spared Ralph from the deadly hatred of the old man. A few minutes later Ralph was picking his way through the boulders, pondering upon the quaintness of backwoods ways and the ease with which an innocent expression of admiration was transformed into an excuse to kill.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace Reid","Released":"15 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Kiss","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Theodosia Harris","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Ruth, the daughter of the ranch owner, one day sees Dakota's display of horsemanship, and the admiration thus aroused soon ripens into love, much against the protest of the family. Ruth's love for Dakota is increased by his heroic deed when he rescues her from the malignant attentions of a rushing steer whose anger is aroused by the flowing red handkerchief about her neck. Dakota, who is riding ahead of the cowboys on a round-up expedition, catches sight of the steer heading for Ruth, and, spurring his broncho into a break-neck speed, reaches the side of the steer, leaps upon its hack, and, fastening his muscular arms on the frenzied beast's horns, brings him to the ground. In the midst of the ovation given him by the cowboys, Dakota is nabbed by Sheriff Mathers, who begins to march him back to the Deer Lodge Penitentiary. As the sheriff, his deputies and his captive are riding along a narrow mountain roadway, Dakota makes a daring leap down the precipitous incline, rolling down until he reaches the bottom, where he hides behind a projecting rock. The sheriff, in the meantime, has taken the long way down and follows for a distance, until he discovers the still form of Dakota behind the sheltering rock, and, thinking him dead, rides away. Though free, Dakota is handicapped by the manacles. He manages to steal the gun and horse belonging to a sleeping shepherd, and by holding the gun between his knees, and placing the connecting chain of the manacles in front of the gun, he pulls with his teeth the strap which he has fastened to the trigger of the gun, thereby severing the connecting links. As he starts to ride away he is observed by a distant rifleman, who, by the aid of binoculars, sees the dangling steel wristlets, proving that he is an outlaw. He fires and Dakota tails from his horse with a head wound. But his left foot gets caught in the stirrup and he is dragged for a long distance with bullets flying around him. His foot eventually gets loose and he is left unconscious on the ground. When he regains consciousness, he finds himself again in the hands of the law, and just before he is about to be incarcerated he marries Ruth Watson, who bravely sobs as he is led away: \"Good bye, my man, when you come back, I'll be waiting.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"William Duncan","Released":"04 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Law and the Outlaw","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"J.

Not being impressed with their looks he spies upon them and discovers that they are making bombs. Securing a pistol he rushes into the room and chases them out. He then runs to the police station, but is kicked out by the cops who resent leaving their game of pinochle interfered with. The revengeful Italians enter the landlord's home while his wife has gone to the store and place their baby in a basket, which they attach to the end of a long spring, taken from an exerciser, and fasten the other end of the spring under the window so that when the window is raised it will permit the basket to fall four stories. The landlord is waylaid and tied to a fence, his gloating captors telling him of what they have done. He is in agony and tugs at his bonds, and manages to get the rope in his mouth, which he vainly tries to chew in two. His wife returns home and missing the baby, thinks he has taken it out. Alternate flashes are shown of the woman In the house and the baby dangling at the end of the spring, and the audience is kept in an expectant frame by the wife going to the window to open it and having her attention distracted by various incidents in time to prevent her from raising the window. A boy finally releases the frantic landlord, who rushes home just in time to save his child.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Mack Sennett","Released":"14 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Life in the Balance","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The father, Lord Harcourt, avoids the little fellow, who is a constant reminder of the woman whose life went out when the long hoped for son came. The art gallery where a full-length oil painting of the sweet-faced woman hangs, is the little boy's favorite resting place. Raymond gazes on the face, and he fancies that his mother smiles at him. Then in a fantasy he sees his mother step out of the frame. They hold sweet communion, and the boy feels that he is no longer alone. They play and romp over the lawn. The fantasy continues: his mother hears his evening prayer, he kneels by her side and repeats the words she has taught him. She lays him in his little bed and tells him stories till the \"sand man\" comes to claim him. Then he awakens from his day-dream, and only the sweet figure on the canvas remains. He is sobbing out his disappointment against the unresponsive painting, when a sweet young woman that Lord Harcourt has asked to be his wife, comes upon the motherless boy, and hears his impassioned appeal to his mother to return to him. Her whole heart responds to the child and she takes him in her arms. Lord Harcourt, missing his fiancée, hurries to the picture gallery in search of her and sees the tender scene. The man has never before realized the heart hunger of the motherless boy, and the woman, soon to be his wife, shows him how the child has suffered for a parent's love. Harcourt's conscience reproves him; he tries to atone to the boy, who responds eagerly, and finds happiness at last in the tender arms of his new mother, and in the long denied companionship of his father.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Lloyd B.

The engagement is announced. Tom Trude, the brother of Mabel, is a sort of shiftless fellow and is exceedingly unlucky at cards. It required but little argument on the part of the acknowledged best man of the community to win Tom over to his gang, as he hopes to make good his losses at cards in some manner other than actual labor. The post office is held up and the sheriff called upon to bring the perpetrators to justice. A lively encounter is followed by the escape and pursuit of one of the men. The sheriff himself takes up the chase and successfully runs down the man. To his consternation, it proves to be Mabel's brother. He passes their home with the prisoner in tow. Mabel argues and pleads, but to no avail, and she finally plays her largest card--her love, against her brother's liberty. The mental struggle of the sheriff is intense, but he wins, and as he pockets the engagement ring returned to him by Mabel, he marches his prisoner off to jail.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace Reid","Released":"02 Jan 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Love and the Law","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Wallace Reid (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Poor Jones is downcast when he learns that Mabel is to marry Smith, and follows Smith home. He learns that Smith is already married and has ten little children. Peering through the window he sees the terror-stricken family bullied by Smith. Smith and Mabel go to the minister's house to be married, and Jones, dogging their footsteps, attempts to interfere but is driven away by Smith. Jones has an idea, and rushing to the Smith home he tells Mrs. Smith that her husband is marrying another girl. She grabs two arms full of little ones, and with the rest toddling at her heels she arrives in time to prevent the wedding. Smith and his wife and the kids go home, and Jones gets the gin. In revenge, Smith captures Mabel and carries her to the old saw mill. Tying her on a board he awaits the moment when the saw shall cut her in two. Jones tries to rescue her but is driven away by Smith. Jones telephones the police, who have many exciting adventures before they reach the spot. In despair, Jones holds back the big fly wheel. It lifts him off his feet and he revolves rapidly around, but he finally masters it and holds it back.

From the refuge she had gone to South Africa as a nurse during the war and while there met Grace Rosebury, the daughter of General Rosebury, who had come for temporary shelter to one of the field hospitals. The general's daughter was wet and cold. Mercy loaned her a nurse's uniform. The two girls, during their brief acquaintance, became good friends, and Grace Rosebury told Mercy that she was going to England to stay with friends of her father, whom she had never seen, and that it bad been arranged that she was to marry one of the nephews of the house. Suddenly a shell hit the hospital and a flying splinter struck Grace Rosebury on the head. In the confusion that followed, the surgeon, seeing her in a nurse's uniform, mistook her for a nurse, and after a rapid examination, pronounced her dead. An opportunity had arisen and Mercy could not resist the temptation. She had never known happiness and Grace had never known misery. She took Grace Rosebury's effects, and declared herself to be the general's daughter. She arrived safely in England, and was received with open arms by Lady Janet Roy and her nephew. She soon won her way into the hearts of all the family, but her happiness could not last. She must be found out sooner or later. One of the first people she met at the house of Lady Janet Roy was Julian Grey, the pastor of the refuge. He remembered her at once, but she denied all knowledge of him. To make matters worse, she fell in love with him and he with her, despite her nominal engagement to Lady Janet's nephew. The crisis came when the real Grace Rosebury, who was not dead, arrived on the scene and denounced Mercy as an impostor. Everyone immediately turned against Mercy except Julian Grey, who loved her and offered her his care and protection.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Charles Brabin","Released":"06 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Mercy Merrick","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Charles Brabin (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

One such house is filled mainly with circus people, a decidedly motley crowd. Among them is a fat lady, a female living skeleton, a strong man, a seven-foot giant and a two-foot midget woman. Various love affairs are in progress. Both the giant and the strong man love the fat lady, while the living skeleton wants the strong man, who hates her. One night, the strong man, who is jealous of the midget, offers her many indignities, such as squashing her under his high bat. Her part is taken by the giant, who has taken quite a fancy to her. Enraged at the treatment she has received, the midget determines to put a kink in the strong man's freshness and incidentally do a good turn to the giant. Carefully watching the movements of the strong man, the midget sees him leave notes at the rooms of both the living skeleton and of the fat lady. With the assistance of the giant, she gets over the transom of the fat lady's door and takes the note, which she exchanges with that left under the door of the skeleton's room. The result is that each woman gets the letter intended for the other. When they all meet in the morning, the skeleton falls on the neck of the strong man and warmly embraces him, much to his disgust, while the fat lady seeks consolation in the arms of the love-sick giant. Both the midget and the giant are satisfied with their night's adventure.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Bert Angeles","Released":"23 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Midget's Revenge","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Marguerite Bertsch","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Who put mucilage on Miss Galgreen's false teeth? Who flirted with the French dancing teacher? Who put snuff in the school books? The answer was, \"Miss Mischief.\" The girl remained at the seminary exactly one month. The principal finally expelled her. Farm life is usually very monotonous and the section where \"Miss Mischief's\" parents lived was no exception to the rule. But the girl soon made the little rural community as lively as Main Street on Saturday night. Her father always had to hunt for his spectacles, tacks seemed to find their way into his cowhide boots, the dog frequently raced wildly about the yard with a tin can tied to his tail, and the minister passed the doorway with a hostile glare. The boys all liked her and neglected work so frequently that their irate fathers had to threaten them with horsewhips to induce them to work. The girls, robbed of sweethearts, prayed for some awful fate to befall the siren. Two young men, to whom the girl showed the most favor, had decided to fight a duel, but the girl laughed them out of the idea, and persuaded them to settle the affair by a battle between their pet roosters. The affair was shrouded with mystery and even Miss Mischief's mother did not know about it, But when various masculine and feminine figures came hurling down the grain chute and landed on the ground with resounding thumps, she made inquiries. They excitedly told her that the constable was after them and limped and hobbled away as fast as they could. When it became known that the constable had been no where around and that it was another of \"Miss Mischief's\" pranks, the rage of her dupes was great. So the girl was bundled off to another school whose principal had a reputation as a great disciplinarian, and the little community once more enjoyed peace.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Lloyd Lonergan","Released":"08 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Miss Mischief","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Lloyd Lonergan","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

He calls on Ethel, vows she is the only girl he has ever loved and gives her an engagement ring to bind their faith. He next calls on Gertrude and goes through practically the same performance. He returns home and is informed by his valet that Marguerite, another girl friend of his called him up. He decides to visit her, and does. While there, he again falls in love and gives her a ring to bind their engagement. Later, he walks along the street and is hit by an automobile. A great crowd gathers and while he is not seriously injured, still he is hurt enough to have to be carried home and put in bed. Newspaper reporters get on the job and a full account of the accident and the injuries to Richard appears in all the papers. Ethel reads of it and getting some flowers, proceeds to pay her fiancé a visit. The other girls also read of it and also come to nurse him back to health. The three meet, with the result that a free-for-all fight very nearly ensues when explanations are in order, and results in the throwing of his rings at Richard by all three girls. Later, fulfilling his prediction that the girls like to be fooled, they return, but again they meet and all chances of reconciliation are at an end.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Phillips Smalley","Released":"06 Jul 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Muchly Engaged","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

They write letters, one signing Pa's name, in which he writes that he loves Carrie's Ma, and vice versa. They leave these letters where the couple can find the ones intended for them, which they do. The old fellow immediately becomes frisky and the escapade winds up with them marrying, and Harry and Carrie giving them a great send-off.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Phillips Smalley","Released":"13 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Our Parents-In-Law","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Out of gratitude, she guards the welfare of her benefactors and prompts them to nobler deeds of manhood. Her activity in behalf of her friends causes her to arouse the animosity of the keeper of the one grog shop \"Lonesome\" boasted of and with the decrease in business he conspires against \"Pride,\" as she becomes known to the people. The plots against her were duly foiled and one would have been disastrous to the perpetrators but for the timely arrival of \"Pride,\" who prevents their untimely demise on the promise never to attempt further molestations.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Romance, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace Reid","Released":"03 Jul 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Pride of Lonesome","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Hal Reid (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

They substantiate their deception by bringing into their little game Laura, Ira's daughter, and her fiancé, Jack Brent, a genuine member of the Thirteenth. Their deception runs along nicely until one Friday night, when the men have gone to the club, their wives find the invitation, and are just about to start out when they discover that the water pipe has burst. Laura informs the men by telephone what is discovered, and warns them to hurry home. They arrive and find that the kitchen and dining room are flooded, and, after all has been given a good soaking, Lord Dudley, an admirer of Laura, manages to stop the flow of water. Just as the trouble concerning the flood has subsided, Jack Brent arrives home and tells the men that the Thirteenth has been ordered to the front. The husbands, seeing a good chance to take a little vacation, purchase soldiers' clothing and fall in behind the Thirteenth Regiment as it passes their wives, but slip out as soon as it is out of sight. They then go to the barn, where they substitute their soldiers' habilaments for civilian clothes and then make all possible haste to the lake, where they intend to spend a little vacation. But their vacation is short-lived, for one day they see in the newspapers that the entire Thirteenth regiment has been wiped out. They hurry home to the old barn, where they get into their regimentals as quickly as possible, not forgetting, however, to add a few rents here and there, to make it appear as if they have had a terrible struggle at the front and in escaping. When they arrive home they observe that Mrs. Wilton's brother has returned from the West and had promised to take care of the \"widows.\" In reply to Lena's (the fat cook's), question concerning her lover, Conrad, they were just about to tell her that he died with her name on his lips, when in come Conrad and Harry Brent, with the news that the newspaper report was all wrong. Ira and Harry fix it up with Conrad, and Jack, desiring to keep on the right side of the old man, tells the women that the men had a terrible fight, and brother Tom forgets about asking questions when a couple of good cigars are shoved into his mitt.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"George D.

Rusty laughs at him and tells him he will not get a chance to reform, as the police will hound him to death. Hardy receives a new suit of clothes and five dollars, and is met up the prison door by his daughter, Helen. He gets work in a grocery store, but a detective recognizes him and tells the proprietor that he is harboring an ex-convict, and Hardy is discharged. Helen has been working and saving her money, and she suggests to her father that they go west and start life anew in the west. Hardy is given a chance to make good, being employed as a watchman in the little western bank. Lieut. Baker, of the U. S. Cavalry, meets Helen, and the two young people fall in love. Hardy writes to Rusty as follows: \"Dear Pal Rusty: Got a good job as a night watchman in a bank. Don't laugh. It's on the square. Can you imagine me watching a safe with twenty thousand in it and dead easy to crack, but I'm temptation proof as long as I can let the Amber Devil, whiskey, alone. Look for a letter from you shortly. Your old pal, Jim Hardy.\" A week later Rusty takes advantage of visiting day to secure access to the lockers, and escapes dressed in a guard's uniform. He makes his way to Hardy's town, and is taken in by the latter and fed and clothed. Detective Burton, on the trail of the escaped convict, follows his man. Rusty sees him in a saloon and rushes back in fear to Hardy. He plies Hardy with whiskey, and tells him that the detective will make him lose his Job, and that he had better crack the safe and get away with the money. Helen tries to interfere, but Rusty roughly tells her to keep still or he will tell her sweetheart her father is an ex-convict. That night they attempt to rob the bank. Rusty keeps watch while Hardy enters and blows open the vault doors. The detective is on the job, however, and Hardy finds himself looking into the barrel of a pistol held by Burton at the window. Rusty sneaks up behind the detective and deals him a crashing blow, rendering him unconscious. Helen, who has mustered up courage at the last moment to attempt to stop the robbery and save her father from crime, rushes up and is attacked by Rusty. Hardy runs to the defense of his daughter and in the scuffle is shot and killed, Rusty making his escape. The banker believes that his watchman has been killed by the burglar. Helen confesses everything to Lieut. Baker, who goes to the detective, when he has regained consciousness and persuades him to remain silent regarding Hardy's past. He tells Helen that she is not to blame for her father's sins, and marries her.

Grabbing a gun he bade them leave his estate. Then when they had gone, in replacing his pistol, it dropped, wounding him fatally. With his last strength, he wrote the truth on a slip of paper and placed it in the bible. The Mexicans, headed by Pedro, caught the pair and accused them.

Sally, who is a well-spring of information and is naturally hated by law-breakers. \"Injun\" Jim gets reinforcements and carries off the girl as a hostage. Fred senses they are making for the mine, so he girds on his guns and goes in the same direction.

This saves her sweetheart Fred, who rushes to her rescue, and they both retreat to a cabin. The dynamiters are obstinate and place another cartridge, so that the cabin will be blown to pieces. The daring Fred picks up the keg of powder and rushing out rolls it down on Injun Jim and his fellow mischief-makers.

The drift of this story with danger ever imminent, has plentiful spice of comedy, diversified by daring and wild, exciting drives. It was a time when men thought quick and shot quick, self-preservation being Nature's first law. The stage-coach, having the precious freight of two fair girls and much of Uncle Sam's mail, goes through on schedule time, despite the fact that a band of outlaws leagued to rapture the mail coach. The shotgun man and the driver manage to thwart the plans of the badmen without blood-shed. The company give them ample reward for bringing the mail on time, but more surprising and acceptable is the reward of the fair ones whose lives were saved by their brave guardians.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"William Duncan","Released":"09 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Shotgun Man and the Stage Driver","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"William Duncan (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

A chance remark of the little girl's shows Winnie what a false life she is leading, and she decides to abandon it.

With the idea of developing in the natives in his community the spirit of manly citizenship, Dr. Reid requests the War Department to furnish him with a number of discarded Winchesters with which to drill the natives. His request is granted and he succeeds in getting together quite an enthusiastic company. Dr, Reid is not the only instructor in patriotism. Young Pauline Bush, a teacher in the Islands, has for some time been instructing her pupils in all that the American flag means to her. When she finds that Dr, Reid is also patriotically inclined, a bond of friendship is cemented between the two Americans. Bonita, one of Pauline's pupils, has for some time been deeply but hopelessly in love with the young doctor, and is very despondent when she sees the growing attraction between the young Americans. Her father wishes to join Dr. Reid's company, but because of his age is not allowed to do so. Dr. Reid, however, gives him a gun, which the old man becomes very fond of. Camped close to the settlement is a company of Spaniards, one of whom, through disorderly conduct, is stripped of his uniform and driven from camp. This renegade makes his way to the settlement and there encounters Bonita, the young native girl. Bonita's beauty attracts the renegade, who makes insulting advances to her. Doctor Reid witnesses the encounter and after a short, sharp fight with the renegade, he is sent about his business. The renegade, smarting under the drubbing he has received, vows revenge on the American, and when he discovers him drilling the natives, he hastens to the Spanish camp and informs the officer in charge that the American doctor is teaching the Filippinos war. The Spaniards hasten to the settlement and finding Bonita's father fondling the gun given him by the doctor; they decide to make an example of him. They seize the old man and drag him to a nearby wall, where they proceed to execute him, Bonita, who witnesses the shooting of her father, is wild with grief, and runs to her beloved teacher and tells her what has occurred. Pauline fearlessly rushes to the place of the execution, and furiously reprimands the two Spaniards who are standing by the body. They debate for a moment, then grab the teacher and attempt to drag her away. Dr. Reid, who is hunting nearby, sees the struggle and swiftly dispatches both soldiers. He hastens to Pauline's side and leads both girls away. Dr. Reid realizes the significance of the shooting of the old man and quickly gathers his little company together. They are not a moment too soon, for the Spaniards charge the settlement. The women and children hide at the school house, where they are at last joined by the men, fighting each inch of the way. A desperate battle is waged around the tiny school house and the doctor and his little band are more than outnumbered. Bonita sees the battle from a distance and hastens swiftly to the American camp and informs the officer what she has seen. The American troops hurry to the scene of the conflict and reach the schoolhouse just as the doctor, who has fired his last round of ammunition, is about to surrender. The Americans quickly drive the Spaniards from the field, but Bonita, who has followed, is shot. She falls, clutching the American flag which she has learned to love. Dr. Reid and Pauline find the young native girl and feelingly drape her remains with the silken folds of \"Old Glory.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"07 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Spirit of the Flag","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Wallace Reid","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Sometime later, Ferris discovers the paper, and, desiring to reinstate Steele, calls at his home only to learn that through the death of his invalid wife and his fruitless attempts to secure another position, he and his daughter have immigrated to a distant city. Fifteen years later Steele, returning to the city under an assumed name and now master of millions, determines to bring about the ruin of Ferris, now president of the banking house.

In meditation he hears a voice bidding him to be merciful and at the same time he sees a vision of Christ preaching on the Mount. His strange actions alarm his sister who sends for a doctor, but is told that her brother is only suffering from overwrought nerves. Steele's plans work and a run is precipitated on Ferris' bank. The climax comes when Steele draws a check on Ferris' bank for $25,000. Young Ferris makes frantic appeals to other bankers to come to the aid of his father, but all decline. Under the pretense of desiring solitude the banker sends all persons away, takes a revolver from his desk and shoots himself. As a last resort, Arthur Ferris, ignorant of his father's suicide, goes to Steele, asking him to save his father. Steele, very angry, renounces both father and son. The son is about to throttle Steele, when Marjorie intercedes for her father. Then Steele again hears the mysterious voice, and, calling for a pen and paper, he is about to direct his secretary to deposit enough money in Ferris' bank to tide him over the difficulties when he bears the voices of newsboys yelling \"Suicide of Lindsley Ferris.\" His reparation had been too late and he sinks back, dead in his chair.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"24 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Still Voice","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Mrs. Sidney Drew","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Shortly after the departure of Masterson the domineering superintendent cuts the wages of the employees, thereby bringing ruin not only to the factory, but to the homes of the workmen. Jimmie Blake, a young boy of fourteen, the only support of his sister, Maggie, is brutally struck down by Mooney, the superintendent, for being late one morning. Just then a huge iron beam becomes loosened and crashes down upon Jimmie. The laborers declare a strike and carry the boy to his home where the doctor announces that only an operation performed by a skilled specialist will prevent the boy from being a cripple for life. Being without funds Maggie Blake goes to the factory intent upon robbing the safe. Hearing steps upon the stairs, she hides herself in the closet. Masterson, who has been summoned by Mooney who has had a bad fight with the strikers, places the unconscious superintendent in a chair, and, going to the closet for suitable bandages, discovers Maggie, who tells him that she was hiding from the strikers. Bent upon revenge, Maggie, after sending the capitalist for water that she may bathe Mooney's head, calls upon the telephone \"Bat\" Thomas, her sweetheart, whom she knows is addressing a meeting of the strikers at a hall and tells him that Masterson has her imprisoned in the office. After hearing Maggie's story, Bat leads his men to the office, the door of which is barricaded by Maggie and Masterson. Maggie helping in the barricade work for Masterson, having heard her pitiful story, assures reparation. Bat affects an entrance into the office by climbing to the roof and going through a window. In his struggle with Masterson the stove is upset and soon the room is ablaze. The fire spreads rapidly and soon the whole factory is a scathing mass of flames. By a unique method all escape from the building just before the walls fall in. Later, with the owner at the helm, the Masterson Iron Works again becomes a model factory. Bat, with Maggie as his wife, is the new superintendent, and little Jimmie is restored to health by the specialist.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"George Melford","Released":"25 Jun 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Struggle","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Henry Albert Phillips (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Ben made an appointment to look at the deposit and did so - quite unaware that Jim Halliday, with two bad pals, kept close watch of his every movement. They met him on the road going back and remarked that it was a bad town for experts, to which sully Ben merely smiled. That night Mabel was awakened by a scratching noise. Rising from bed she seized a butcher knife and hurried into the other room. A hand was slowly appearing through a freshly made opening under the cabin. Only the ghastly arm could be seen, but in that fleeting glance Mabel saw an American flag plainly tattooed on the outstretched arm. Without an instant's hesitation she plunged the knife through the arm - there was a howl of pain, hurried footsteps and all was silent again. Next morning when Ben called, he was told of the nocturnal visit. He quietly mounted his horse and rode off in the direction of the claim. In the bushes he saw Halliday standing, with back toward him, an outstretched bare arm resting on a convenient tree trunk. Ben drew his gun, Halliday faced quickly about and a few minutes later was safely lodged in the local jail. Then Ben rode back to the Whitaker cabin as his thoughts turned toward softer things.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Western, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace Reid","Released":"01 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Tattooed Arm","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Wallace Reid","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

This is more than self respecting children can be expected to endure, and taking their treasure with them, they flee from the house. They are finally found on the street by a policeman who questions them. At this moment, Constance, the sweet young woman who is betrothed to their father, rides up in her auto, recognizes the children and stops to bear their tale of woe. She is fairly aghast at their explanation to the officer that they are about to come under the sway of a horrid stepmother who will beat them, starve them, and work them to death. Of course, Nina and Trixie have never seen their father's fiancée to know her as such. Constance seizes her opportunity to win the children. She tells them she will play their fairy godmother and take them to her home where no bad stepmother can ever get them. She gets them home and informs their father by 'phone of the plot she has conceived; he enters into the \"game,\" and is overjoyed with the tact and sweetness of her attitude toward his little ones. Finally the kiddies grow homesick for Daddy, and Constance sends for him. Torn between their two loves, they make Daddy promise to marry their fairy godmother so they will not have to part from her; and thus everybody in the household is made happy.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"E.A.

Years elapse and find Deer Foot and Red Wing prominent pupils at Carlisle. They accept their betrothal as agreeable. An ambitious and unscrupulous half-breed, Mathews, has a fancy for Red Wing. Deer Foot has a rival in Mathews, who succeeds in drugging the former, thereby carrying off the honors in an athletic contest. Red Wing, who has been led to believe Deer Foot lost by drunkenness, snubs him at the party following the athletic meet. Mathews puts fuel to the flame of her indignation, showing her a forged note in which his rival's name is linked with another woman. The same night Deer Foot receives a letter announcing the death of his father, calling him to the reservation to assume chieftainship. He releases his love from the pledge of their fathers. In her misery Red Wing turns to Mathews and they become engaged. Subsequently she learns the half-breed already has a wife. She upbraids him and he strikes her. This breaks the engagement. She meets Deer Foot and tells him of Mathews' perfidy. They follow Mathews when he disbarks from a train.

Each reserves seats. Bingles, to put one over on Binks, gets the rest of the employees to make believe that he is ill. They all tell him that he is looking terribly, until poor Binks decides to go home and go to bed. Just as he is leaving, he overhears Bingles tell the boys that the scheme has worked to perfection. On his way home, he stops at the theater, and tells the ticket-seller that he can cancel two of the seats for that evening, and reserve only two for Binks.

One day Bert, refused admission by Vail, pinned a note to the door-post, intimating that she intended to elope with him that afternoon. At the same time the heart of the old man Reeder relented and he started toward the little bungalow. Thus Harry coming home found the note a minute after, captured Bert and trounced him soundly.

Green, was one of the Napoleons unchanged, but they would not think that this same J. Green was a woman so thoroughly immersed in the intricacies of the Bulls and Bears of the Exchange that all other considerations were forgotten. Her people, happily married and scattered to the four winds, wrote insistent but vain letters to her to abandon money grabbing and enjoy the felicity of normal married life. These letters she treated with contemptuous indifference. No man interested her until Arthur Roydon was brought directly under her notice. During business hours she finds her mind straying to him, and when he enters her office one day, the warm spring tide of love fills her heart. He is all business, cold and aloof, places a check in her bands for stock investment and leaves abruptly. She resolves to win him, but though their meetings at the club are frequent, he remains unchanged. Spurned and lonely, she returns to her apartment late one night and after the expiration of many hours and the consumption of many cigarettes and brandies and sodas, she solves the question. She is too mannish. A phone message to a woman's outfitter's, a change of clothes and manners, and Arthur Hoydon falls completely under the feminine charms of J. Green, his Julia.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Walter Edwin","Released":"28 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"When the Right Man Comes Along","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Mary Fuller","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The adjoining plantation is owned by Robert Harding, a young English gentleman, who seeks his fortune in the cultivation of tea. He has just arrived in the country, and is not acquainted with his neighbors. Zara is a beautiful girl. She delights in outdoor life and is fond of taking morning rides on her big pet elephant, \"Toddles.\" One morning she meets young Harding. He salutes her with a smile and she stops for a chat. It ends by her inviting him to join her in the howdah, \"Toddles\" assisting him to mount. As the result of this meeting Zara and Harding fall in love. About this time Lieut. Driscoll, an aristocratic officer, chances to call at the Haskins plantation, where he is royally entertained by the colonel. He is attracted by Zara's beauty and shows her marked attentions, much to her dislike. Her father is pleased, on the other hand, and shows the lieutenant that he favors his suit. Driscoll begs Zara to accompany him on a ride the following morning. She refuses; but he insists so strongly that Zara grows angry. Then he insultingly asks for a reason and she strikes him with her crop. Afterwards she mounts \"Toddles\" and soon joins young Harding. Driscoll, who has followed her stealthily on horseback, discovers the lovers and immediately carries the news to Colonel Haskins. The colonel is furious and rides at once to the rendezvous of the lovers. There he berates Harding and is about to strike him, when \"Toddles\" seizes him with his trunk. The next day the Colonel assures Driscoll that Zara will be his wife. Zara is called before the two men and indignantly refuses to obey her father. The latter threatens to force her. She notifies Harding and they elope. Lieut. Driscoll spies on their movements and conveys word to the colonel, who is seized with temporary apoplexy at the news. He recovers sufficiently to despatch Driscoll to prevent the clergyman from performing the ceremony. Driscoll arrives too late, as Zara and Harding are man and wife. Colonel Haskins refuses to receive Zara and renounces her. Three years elapse and the Harding household is blessed with a baby. Zara learns that her father, under the evil influence of Driscoll, is a victim of intemperance. She calls at the old home with her child, hoping for reconciliation; but her father refuses to receive her at the prompting of Driscoll. She calls again, with the same result. Now \"Toddles\" takes a hand. He carries the baby and the cradle in which it lies to the colonel. He places the cradle on the steps, but the colonel waves him away. \"Toddles\" shakes his trunk in token of refusal, and in brute language urges his master to take the child to his heart. The colonel gives in and takes up the cradle with its cooing burden. Then \"Toddles\" grasps his master's hand in his trunk and leads him to the Harding home.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Colin Campbell","Released":"14 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Wise Old Elephant","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"J.

She gives oat her ideas in a bale-fellow-well-met-way to the modest man and be retires to sadly think it over as she goes joyously on to \"whoop it up\" at a suffrage meeting. Returning from a day of strenuous service in disorder and window smashing, she casts herself in exhaustion upon the couch in her study and falls asleep. Then comes to her in dreams a picture of the quiet, delightful days of old, so well remembered from the tales told by her grandmother. Old Father Time makes bold to intrude and conduct her back along the path of the storied past, decade by decade, until she arrives at the age of gallantry, when great grandmother was a girl. It shows the courtly old days in the quaint, colonial mansion where grand dames, powdered beauties, periwigged old gallants and lively beaux danced to stately and dignified minuet. This is all in striking contrast to the syncopated ragtime and \"animal dances\" that hold cheap and unworthy possession in current esteem. She awakens in shame at the present conditions, tears the banner calling \"votes for women\" from the wall of her room, and again surrenders herself to the gentle surroundings of her true sphere. The disappointed lover having gained in manhood correspondingly comes to claim his own. In view of the fact that the right to love and be happy is absolutely constitutional.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Lem B.

He is accompanied by his daughter, Bessie, and her fiancé, Tom, a custom that has been hallowed by tender memories ever since her babyhood. The scene shifts to the next recurrence of the anniversary. Bessie, in the interim, has eloped, while under the malign influence of a quick infatuation. She is too ashamed and too proud to write a word of explanation to the captain and Tom, in their grief and loneliness. The poor, lonely old soldier tries hard to forget, but his grief is too poignant. Ho cannot even gather flowers again. His sole comfort is considerate Tom, who continues as his faithful friend. Five years passed. Life has been growing harder for Bessie, although she has been deserted by her worthless husband. One day she happens to see a motion picture called \"Memorial Day In a Country Town.\" On the screen before her, she sees again her old home, the town poet, her brave, faithful, first sweetheart Tom, and then her dear old father, too feeble to keep step with the other soldiers, staggering in his weakness and falling from the ranks. This wordless message from the past, breaks her selfish pride and sends her back to the old home in meekness and happiness. There, in the old garden, she finds once more love and happiness, after the flight of years.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Colin Campbell","Released":"28 May 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Wordless Message","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Hettie Grey Baker (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

He wrote an anonymous note and attached it to Ben's saddle, saying \" She don't love you. She was with Bill Higgins all day yesterday. A Friend.\" When Ben found it he frowned and tucked it idly into his pocket. This happened regularly thereafter. If Ben had been a trifle older he might have smiled derisively, but he didn't. Youth and jealousy are old acquaintances and so Ben made his visits shorter and shorter. One day, lonesomeness overcame him and he sent the notes in a bundle to Margy. She read them and promptly burst into tears. Then, with true Western suddenness, she hurried into the house, where she told her brother all her trouble. The later only smiled, but looked more serious when he caught Margy loading a big six-shooter. He told Bill to watch out for himself and ceased further to trouble himself. But Bill was more wise. Carefully unloading the bullets, he substituted blanks and when Margy later threatened him he only smiled. And then Ben rode up, utterly miserable and determined upon an understanding with Margy.

When the plantation and slaves are sold at auction, Cameo's favorite body-servant is bought at auction by one of his father's friends, John Randall. John and Kirby head north on a Mississippi river boat where Randall meets Colonel Moreau. There he loses heavily on a wager and consents to a game of poker hoping to get back his losses. Kirby, through his friendship with another gambler, is adept at the manipulation of cards and suspects that Moreau is not an honest player. He joins the game and soon Randall, having lost all of his money, wagers the old homestead. Kirby wins the hand and Moreau accuses him of cheating while Randall, unappreciative of the fact that Kirby won the hand to keep Randall's estate falling into Moreau's hands, shoots himself. When his body is taken ashore, Kirby meets Randall's daughter, Adele, and instantly falls in love with her. But Kirby is on very shaky ground as he is known as the man who caused Adele's father to commit suicide, and she treats him to some southern disdain. Her brother, Tom, vows to take revenge on Kirby. He and Moreau have an un-witnessed duel and Colonel is shot dead by Kirby, who is somewhat of a dead shot among his many other talents. But Tom takes the gun from Moreau's hand so it will appear he was unarmed. Kirby, slave-owner becomes a fugitive from justice. This also deals a blow to his courtship of Adele. But, a true-blue southern gentleman such as Kirby should be able to win the day, sooner or later.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"N/A","Released":"24 Dec 1914","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"50 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Cameo Kirby","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Booth Tarkington, Harry Leon Wilson","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

One day, the Fairy Godmother appears to the family disguised as an elderly, destitute woman. The others treat her harshly, but Cinderella is kind to her and feeds her. The Fairy Godmother invisibly helps Cinderella, helping her when she goes to gather wood, and enabling her to meet Prince Charming as he travels through the forest. Soon afterward, the king plans a great ball so that the prince can meet all the women and choose one for his bride. Cinderella must help her family prepare for the ball, while she stays at home.

The friendship of Damon, the senator, and Pythias, the soldier, is famous in Ancient Syracuse. Because the general Dionysius is infatuated with Calanthe, Pythias' sweetheart, he sends the soldier to fight the Carthaginians at the Battle of Agrigentum. Pythias returns in triumph, and then angers Dionysius even further when he defeats Aristle, the general's favorite, in a chariot race. During the wedding ceremony for Pythias and Calanthe, Dionysius has himself proclaimed sovereign while Damon is absent from the Senate. Shocked, Damon attempts to assassinate Dionysius, but he fails and is sentenced to death. In order for Damon to say goodbye to his wife and son, Pythias leaves Calanthe and takes his friend's place in prison, offering to die in Damon's place if he does not return. Despite several tests of the strength of their friendship, they remain loyal to each other and so impress Dionysius that he allows them both to go free.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Otis Turner","Released":"23 Nov 1914","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"1 h 40 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Damon and Pythias","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Ruth Ann Baldwin, Edward George Bulwer-Lytton","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Columbia produced a series of Charles Starrett westerns that they called \"Peter B. Kyne productions\" but, other than allowing the use of his name, writer Peter B. Kyne was not the producer on any of the films in this series, and didn't even write the few he is credited with by some sources. Since the source for this error is one of those often-used and often-wrong sources that many researchers use, and said source is one of those that never bother correcting the multitude of errors in their catalogs, the chances of some uninformed source adding Peter B. Kyne back to this film as the Producer is highly likely. This Harold Shumate story finds Texas ranch-foreman Steve Braddock in charge of driving a large herd of cattle overland from Texas to Dodge City, Kansas. Slim Grayson, the eastern-educated son of the ranch owner, is along to sing songs around the campfire. The trail drive part only lasts until the herd reaches Plainview, where Steve, Slim and the cowhands rescue Marian Phillips after she has been kidnapped off a stage by a gang led by Dawson. She tells Steve her father is a local rancher named Phillips, who she has not seen since she was a young girl, but Steve knows no rancher by that name but from her description, he feels sure that Plainview gambling-hall owner Kenyon Jackson is her father. Of course he is and he, of course, is also the secret head of the Dawson gang, and Steve's tasks are to keep Marian from learning the truth about her father, cleaning up the gang and persuading the father to reform. By the way, Peter B. Kyne did not produce this film.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Music, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Charles C.

Blaming his infant daughter Dixie for his wife's death, Phillips leaves her with Mrs. Hughes, his housekeeper. Meanwhile, Mrs. Moore, a wardrobe mistress who has kept a scrapbook on Phillips, must raise her infant daughter Florence alone when her husband dies. Eighteen years later, Mrs. Hughes has squandered all of Phillips' money on her ne'er-do-well son Bert. Dixie then leaves and goes to New York where she receives a part in a Broadway play from Marc Herbert, her father's friend. When Phillips returns looking for Dixie, Mrs. Hughes and Bert convince Florence, Bert's new wife, to pose as Dixie. She soon is disgusted by the plot, however, and returns to her mother, with whom Dixie now lives. Meanwhile, Herbert innocently sends Phillips word of Dixie's success, but when he goes to see her, she bitterly rebukes him. Phillips again leaves, but eventually he and Florence realize their feelings for each other and are able to marry after Bert dies in a burglary attempt. After Mrs. Moore's death, Dixie is reconciled to her father.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Phillips Smalley","Released":"17 Dec 1914","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"32 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"False Colors","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Lois Weber (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}
