But when the queen delivers a twin, Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution, and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu out-smarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever. Richelieu enlists D'Artagnan to look after and protect the young prince. Meanwhile, de Rochefort learns of the twins and Richelieu's plans, and kidnaps the twin, raising him in secret. Many years later, with Richelieu dead and the young prince crowned King Louis XIV, Rochefort launches his plan. The king is kidnapped, replaced with his twin, put in an iron mask so as not to be recognized, and led off to a remote castle to be held prisoner. Louis XIV is able to alert D'Artagnan, who realizes that only his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis can help him, so he reunites the Musketeers to derail Rochefort's nefarious plot but at a heavy toll.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.6","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, History","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Allan Dwan","Released":"21 Feb 1929","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"95 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"1,169","tomatoFresh":"4","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Iron Mask","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"18 Jun 2002","Writer":"Lotta Woods (scenario editor), Douglas Fairbanks (story), Alexandre Dumas père (novels)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"77"}

Raymond's first case, appointed to him by the courts, is a murder case. His pitiful and poor Jane Doe client, who refers to herself only as Madame X, admits to killing the scoundrel of a man named Laroque, but won't disclose why or in turn defend herself in court. Raymond knows nothing of her past, which includes once being a woman of class, married to man of prestige. But that marriage ended because he treated her without love, which resulted in her leaving him for another man, who in turn passed away shortly thereafter. Her first marriage produced a son, who her husband refused to let her see. Her son never knew she was alive, he being told by his father that she died. The consequence of his action left Madame X on a downward path where she never found love. Now, in turn, she hopes her silence will protect the one that she really loves, he who doesn't even know about her selfless sacrifice.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.6","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Lionel Barrymore","Released":"17 Aug 1929","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"95 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"136","tomatoFresh":"1","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Madame X","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Alexandre Bisson (from the play by), Willard Mack (dialogue)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"33"}

He is panty-whipped by his social climbing second wife. She has recruited Clifford Figfield to stage and direct a charity pageant, which is more a means for her to hobnob with the social elite, and to nab Larry Lodge, the pageant's leading man, as a husband for her flighty daughter Phyllis, the pageant's leading lady. Larry ends up only having eyes for Sally McNitt, Mr. McNitt's visiting daughter, and she, in turn has eyes for him. Some misunderstandings on Larry's part - he ends up believing that Sally is the household maid, and that she and Mr. McNitt are having an affair - and Mrs. McNitt trying to maneuver Sally out of the way may prevent a Sally/Larry happy ending. But Phyllis coming to a decision of her own and Mr. McNitt looking out for the welfare of his daughter may throw wrenches into the proceedings.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Harry Edwards","Released":"31 Mar 1929","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"23 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Matchmaking Mamma","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Carl Harbaugh, Jefferson Moffitt, John A.

Among those on board are Al and Travis, Americans who are traveling Europe spending Travis' money, and Marie, a German girl. The boys save Marie after the wreck and Travis falls in love with her. When World War I breaks out Al wants to enlist, but Travis can't, feeling loyal to Marie, a German. By 1917 Al has enlisted, and Travis follows him shortly after marrying Marie. Accused of being a German spy by a Russian agent, she is sentenced to die but is recognized by Travis, who is part of the firing squad. The town they are in is shelled and they are all trapped underground, during which a minister makes a lengthy parallel to ancient times when the King of Akkad persecuted his subjects and defied Jehovah, who finally sends a flood to wipe out mankind, except for Noah and his family, whom he has instructed to build an ark and fill it with two of every creature on earth.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"57","tomatoUserRating":"3.1","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, War","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Michael Curtiz, Darryl F.

As recounted in Arthur Koestler's The Case of the Midwife Toad (1971), Kammerer (1880-1926) claimed that darkened footpads he had artificially induced in a toad had been passed on to its offspring. When it was discovered that his critical specimen had been injected with ink (though why and by whom is still unknown), his credibility was destroyed and he apparently suicided. Richard Goldschmidt's synopsis of the film in \"Research and Politics,\" Nature (1949), mocks it as Soviet propaganda in support of the inheritance of acquired characters: The importance attached to the subject is revealed by the facts that none other than the then all-powerful [People's] Commissar for [Public] Education, the highly cultured and intelligent Lunacharsky, is the author of the film, that his wife plays the leading lady and that Lunacharsky, playing himself, appears in one scene.... In a Central European University a young biologist (model Kammerer) is working. He is a great friend of the people and endowed with all the qualities of a Communist movie hero. Working with salamanders, he has succeeded in changing their colour by action of the environment. One day the supreme glory is achieved; the effect is inherited. The bad man of the play, a priest, learns of this, comes to the conclusion that the discovery will spell an end to the power of the Church and the privileged classes, and decides to act. He meets at night in a church... with a young prince of the blood whom he had succeeded in having appointed as assistant to Kammerer. (This is obviously a typical job for a German prince!) Here in the dark sacristy the plot is hatched. The prince (or the priest?) proposes to Kammerer that he announce his glorious discovery at a formal University meeting, and the scientist gladly accepts. During the following night the priest and the prince enter Kammerer's laboratory... open the jar in which the proof specimen of salamander is kept in alcohol, and inject the specimen with ink.... [A]t the University meeting... the young scientist... makes a brilliant speech announcing the final proof for the inheritance of acquired characters.... [Suddenly someone] takes out the salamander, and dips it into a jar of water. All the colour runs out of the specimen. An immense uproar starts and Kammerer is ingloriously kicked out of the University as an impostor. Some time later, we see the poor young scholar walking the streets and begging with an experimental monkey which had followed him into misery. He is completely forgotten until one of his former students... succeeds in finding him, finally, completely down and out, in a miserable attic. She takes the train at once to Moscow and obtains an interview with Lunacharsky..., who gives orders to save the victim of 'bourgeois' persecution. Meanwhile, the character of Kammerer has sunk so low that he decides to make an end of it. The very moment he tries to commit suicide, the Russian student returns with Lunacharsky's message and prevents him from taking his life. The last scene shows a train in which Kammerer and the Russian saviour are riding east and a large streamer reads 'To the land of liberty.'","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"N/A","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Grigori Roshal","Released":"12 Apr 1928","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Soviet Union, Germany","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Salamandra","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Georgiy Grebner, Anatoli Lunacharsky","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

But Baptista will not allow the two to get married until his eldest daughter, the extremely headstrong Katherine, is betrothed. This task seems impossible because of Katherine's shrewish demeanor. They believe their prayers have been answered with the arrival from Verona of the lusty Petruchio, whose father has just passed, leaving him to travel the world and marry. Having not yet met her, Petruchio agrees to court Katherine when he is told of her beauty and wit. Petruchio is even more excited at the prospect of marrying this wildcat of a woman after meeting her. Katherine will have none of it, even if it means her sister's spinsterhood, but has no choice but to marry him. Beyond the fact of the marriage itself, Katherine is even more irked by Petruchio's less than conventional behavior at the ceremony and post ceremony bridal feast. Each starts to play what they consider sly games of oneupsmanship with each other to gain the upper hand in the marriage.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"78","tomatoUserRating":"3.6","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Sam Taylor","Released":"30 Nov 1929","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"63 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"59","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Taming of the Shrew","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"William Shakespeare (play), Sam Taylor (adaptation)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"78"}

At a fiesta where horse races are traditionally run, a stranger notices Dermod's exceptionally fast horse, Pathfinder, and urges him to enter the horse in the race.

When Pathfinder wins, Dermod takes the ranch as his share of the winnings and gives it to Don José's daughter, Josephita, with whom he had fallen in love earlier, when he met her. Dermod and Bejabbers leave to search for gold, and the town grows rich as more and more gold is amassed. Meanwhile, a bandit chief, Cannon, met Josephita's brother, Romauldo, and forced him to join the gang, which planned to loot the town of its gold before Wells and Fargo shipped it east. As two of the gang set a fire to draw most of the townsmen to put it out, Dermod overhears them discussing the plan and warns the townsmen to stay put.

That night, Winslow and his henchman Jim show up to rob the safe, but Louise is working late on the books. She discovers them, but Jim tells her that Morrow is one hard customer and when he finds his safe has been emptied, he will most likely have her jailed for theft, since she and Morrow are the only ones who know the safe combination. They leave with the loot, and Louise thinks maybe she might be better off gone herself, since she has no way to prove she wasn't involved. She calls her brother and heads for his mountain retreat and, via a telegram left on his desk, learns that he has gone to Chicago to sign a contract with his publisher. But his faithful dog Muro is there to greet her. But the big-city detectives have traced Louise as far as Pine Points, Nevada, where they lose her trail. To relieve her monotony Louise makes a long-distance acquaintanceship with Norman Bard , an airmail pilot whose ship flies over the house each day. Bard drops Lousie copies of the Nevada News each day. Meanwhile, Winslow and Jim have also trekked westward and have just robbed the bank in the town where Louise goes grocery shopping. They make an escape and end up at Louise's hideout. She gets away long enough to climb up on the roof and write the message \"Help.\" Bard sees the message and lands his plane and heads for the house.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Harry S.

While the cat is away, Mickey, Minnie, and the other mice living underneath the porch, will play. Mickey forms another mouse into a key to open the padlock on the door, and then into the house everyone goes. Mickey and Minnie dance on the piano to play music, while the other mice use whatever they can get their hands on - a saxophone, a violin, even a spittoon - to accompany him. A parrot attempts to join in, but the effort of his bad singing causes him to lose his balance and fall into the spittoon. Later, Mickey uses a mousetrap as a catapult to toss himself up to a wheel of Swiss cheese on a high shelf. But these mice are more interested in music than in eating. Mickey slices the cheese in a circular fashion that allows it to act like a paper roll for the player piano. When the roll is finished, two mice form themselves into a makeshift phonograph, which means more fun and music for everyone.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Walt Disney","Released":"11 Apr 1929","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"7 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"When the Cat's Away","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

When he finds out that she's fallen in love with Bobby Bailey, the son of a wealthy circus owner he frequently deals with, Haynes is initially suspicious of the young man's motives. However, Bailey's sincerity soon wins him over, and they take the river boat to Saigon together to see the young man's father. While on board Bobby meets the femme fatale cougar, Mme. de Sylva, who immediately desires the young man and easily seduces him. In reality, she is Toyo's mother and a notoriously predatory seductress. Tiger adamantly insinuates himself between de Sylva and her latest conquest and seemingly breaks up the romance and returns home to oversee Toyo and Bobby's wedding, but Toyo's mother unexpectedly arrives with the objective of vamping Bobby.

On the ship, she witnesses Javanese Prince De Gace mercilessly whipping a servant and shrinks in horror from the sight. When John is befriended by the Prince, who is very attracted to Lillie, she tries to have little to do with him. During a conversation in their room, John is called away to answer a wire, and the Prince steals a kiss in his absence, for which she slaps him. So she is understandably upset when John accepts the Prince's invitation to stay at his plantation in Java when he promised to arrange a tiger hunt. She tries to dissuade John from going, but John says he always wanted to shoot a tiger and she is being unreasonable. Once at the plantation, John is too busy to pay much attention to Lillie, and when he is away, the Prince tries to seduce her. Lillie flees in tears after another kiss, afraid of her own emotions. Finally, she embraces the Prince when he tries again, after John has left to see other plantations. But he returns early and sees their silhouette against the shade, his first awareness of what was going on. Alerted by the sound of the gate opening, the Prince quickly sends Lillie to her room and substitutes a servant in his arms. But the ploy doesn't work as John find Lillie's trinket on the sofa. John suggests tiger hunting at night and goads the Prince into going with him. A tiger is spotted and when the Prince lifts his gun and fires, it becomes apparent John removed the bullets from his gun. Stunned by facing both the tiger and an angry John with a loaded gun, he flees, with the tiger in pursuit. John raises his gun and fires.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"38","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Romance, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Sidney Franklin","Released":"23 Feb 1929","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"100 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"78","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Wild Orchids","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"John Colton (story), Hanns Kräly (continuity), Richard Schayer (continuity), Willis Goldbeck (adaptation), Marian Ainslee (titles), Ruth Cummings (titles)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"38"}

The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"97","tomatoUserRating":"3.9","tomatoConsensus":"Director Lewis Milestone's brilliant anti-war polemic, headlined by an unforgettable performance from Lew Ayres, lays bare the tragic foolishness at the heart of war.","Genre":"Drama, War","Awards":"Won 2 Oscars.

The squirrels are collecting corn cobs too, but a crafty crow is not above stealing them out of the squirrels' tree. The crow brings them back to his fellows, where they store them in a scarecrow's long underwear. A skunk is having bad luck trying to shove an oversized pumpkin through an undersized tree hole and succeeds only in smashing it to bits. A porcupine has a clever way to collect apples: on his quills. The beavers bark and dance happily as they build their dam. The ducks quack merrily as they eat worms.

They have a contentious professional and personal relationship, her jealous self who cannot tolerate his constant flirting. He really aspires to be a serious opera singer, he under the tutelage of Estaban. Once the greatest impresario in Spain himself, Estaban lost everything because of the same reckless behavior that Juan now exhibits, that behavior which Estaban is trying to quell in Juan. Estaban's plan is to get one of his old contacts in Madrid, an impresario, to manage Juan's career to get him serious singing gigs, leading to that fame and fortune Esteban once used to have. It's love at first sight when Juan meets Maria Consuelo Vargas. What he initially doesn't know is that their meeting was by no accident, as she, a postulant at St. Agustín convent who just escaped from that life, had been mesmerized by him and his singing every time she saw him as she peered over the convent wall to the cantina. As she tells him that she has no home, he takes her in. When he learns that she used to be a nun in training, he has to decide whether to marry her as is his want, or try to get her back to the convent. Factored into his decision may be her brother, Army Captain Enrique Vargas, who believes she is destined to be married to God, jealous Lola, and his and Estaban's own aspirations for his singing career.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Musical","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Charles Brabin","Released":"16 Aug 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"100 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Call of the Flesh","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Dorothy Farnum (story), John Colton (dialogue)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Elephants dance with bells on their feet, and even turn their trunks into steering wheels and pretend to be cars. The giraffes dance, too, with wooden clogs on their feet. The mouse clown in the parade performs somersaults, but his impressive antics are mainly for his girlfriend, the mouse bareback rider who is just ahead of him, blowing kisses from her fat horse. The side show features a scantily-clad fat lady, who shakes her exposed buttocks provocatively, enticing the audience to flock inside the tent. Inside, the bareback rider performs her gravity-defying stunts. The clown forms his arms into a hoop for leopards to leap through. He even makes the \"okay\" sign, and a leopard defies physics by jumping through his fingers (and losing his spots in the process). The ringmaster doubles as a lion tamer and performs a dance with a ferocious lion, who ends the routine by kicking his tamer in the rear. The clown angers the ringmaster by laughing at him. The ringmaster retaliates by adding extra gunpowder to the clown's cannon, causing it to shoot him through the tent and out of sight. When the clown returns, he discovers the ringmaster has stolen his two-timing girlfriend.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Harry Bailey, John Foster","Released":"28 Sep 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Circus Capers","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

When he notices that a tiger is stalking him, he turns his gun on the beast and shoots. But an impotent bullet falls harmlessly to the ground. Bosko tricks the tiger into singing and dancing with him. Then, when he gets the chance, he removes the tiger's rear flap, exposing the big cat's polka-dotted underpants, and kicks him off a cliff. Later, Bosko plays with a baby ape, who spits in his eye. Bosko removes its flap, exposing its bare bottom, and spanks it. The father ape enters, and he's angry. Bosko gives him a stick of chewing gum. This placates him, especially when he and Bosko stretch the gum out of their mouths and pluck a tune. Soon all the animals in the jungle begin playing each other, their own body parts, or the trees, as if they were musical instruments. A coconut tree dances, slapping its rear and shaking its coconut-breasts until one falls off and hits Bosko on the head. Three hyenas laugh, and Bosko good-naturedly joins in.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Family, Animation, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising","Released":"01 Aug 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"6 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Congo Jazz","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

But the craziest people in Rubin's mind may be the staff, especially Dr. Smith, who believes he can cure Rubin by operating. In the end, is Rubin really crazy or are the crazy ones the writers?","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Jack Cummings","Released":"01 Nov 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"16 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Crazy House","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Mom blows what's left of her fortune to provide the best trousseau that money can buy when Alice marries Fred Garlan, and then wishes Fred lots of luck. Now, Alice is trying to coax Fred into buying her a new sable coat---all of her friends are sporting them---while Fred is busily trying to borrow enough money to keep his business afloat. This marriage business certainly isn't working out like living-with-Mom, and Alice just doesn't know how she can be seen if she isn't wearing a new sable coat. But, help is lurking just around the corner in the form of a sleaze-ball named Morrell. He's a stock-broker and he is a bachelor and he enjoys the benefits of married life by making available sable coats to little brides who are in dire need of one and whose husbands can't meet their needs. But the wives can meet Morrell's needs. Soon, Fred is asking lots of snooping questions of his new bride, such as where did you get that new sable coat? Fred has doubts that Alice caught and skinned a sable in their back yard.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Phil Rosen","Released":"10 Oct 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"71 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Extravagance","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"A.P.

The mice laying bricks dance as they work. Bosko uses a handsaw to decapitate a mouse and then bounce the mouse's head and its body (which is frantically trying to retrieve the head) even higher. Later, the reconnected mouse and a rivet-eating goat send a beam up to Bosko, who rides it high into the air. From this lofty position, he spots Honey in her high-rise apartment. He plucks musical notes out of the ropes of a pulley, and then uses the floating notes to step from his beam into the apartment. He puts sheet music in Honey's typewriter, and types out music as if it were a piano. Honey dances to the music, periodically disconnecting her torso from her legs. Bosko grabs the goat, which is now filled with hot air and floating like a balloon, and plays it like bagpipes. But a sudden spray of goat's milk knocks Bosko to the ground, splitting him into several selves, which play the bricks on a wall like piano keys.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Family, Animation, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising","Released":"01 Nov 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"6 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Hold Anything","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

He then plans to take her to his father's estate to meet his relatives. His father, Lord Crayle, has summoned the immediate family to discuss how to prevent John from marrying beneath his station. When they meet Elsie, they are all shocked she is a commoner except cousin Edward, whose opinion is discounted, since he is involved with a married woman in Paris. After being queried, Elsie senses the meeting is senseless and starts to leave, but Edward persuades her not to accept defeat. Meanwhile, Elsie's father arrives and, although derided as a commoner by the family, agrees with them that the marriage is a mistake. He says that Elsie has only agreed to marry John because of the published engagement, and that she's not in love with him at all: she had turned him down twice a day for a year. He suggests that the family ask Elsie to wait six months, and to retire from the stage and stay with them. He is certain that Elsie will become so bored with John and country life, that she will run back to the stage. So Elsie stays, but she and Edward secretly fall in love during the next few months. He says he will give up the woman in Paris, who he had earlier said he would marry if he could. News comes over the radio, however, that the woman's husband died, leading Elsie to feel Edward has an obligation to go back to the woman and marry her. Although Edward is resolute in breaking with this woman, once he talks to her on the telephone, he has a hard time doing so. And John, too, has some ideas concerning his relationship with Elsie.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Romance, Comedy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Sidney Franklin","Released":"24 May 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"76 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Lady of Scandal","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Frederick Lonsdale (from the play by), Hanns Kräly (scenario), Claudine West (dialogue adaptation), Edwin Justus Mayer (dialogue adaptation)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Dan knows that Malden has a weakness for drink, gambling and girls and follows him to town, where he finds him playing cards with gamblers Fox Tyson (Charles King) and saloon owner Ace Brady (William Thorne) who, with the aid of bar girl Queenie (Carmelita Geraghty), are well on their way to cheating him out of his share of the claim. Dan puts the stop to that, but Malden is killed by Tyson and Dan is framed for the killing. He escapes and saves Alice from a stagecoach disaster, and takes her to his and Malden's cabin, but doesn't let her know he is wanted for the death of her brother. But Ace and Tyson quickly inform her, and are well on their way to getting all of the Barton/Malden gold mine.

Rankin (not Rankins) shoots Tug, who is unaware of Rankin's lawless activities, in an argument and Jim is accused of murder and also stampeding the sheep. Believing Jim is guilty, Tug's daughter, Ruth, aids Buck in capturing Jim, but he escapes. Ruth gets help from Sheriff Hank Bosley, and a sheepherder, Sanchez, reveals Rankin's responsibility for both the rustling of Bledsoe's cattle and the killing of Wilson.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"J.P.

He is well-liked and affectionately called 'Old English' by the people of Liverpool, allowing him to settle a fixed amount to be paid from his salary, which all but one of the creditors, Charles Ventnor, begrudgingly accept. Ventnor asks Heythorp to settle his £300 debt to him in full, but Heythorp refuses. Mrs. Rosamund Larne, the widowed wife of Heythorpe's late illegitimate son, asks for an increase in his support money, else she will have to reduce certain amenities, such as dance lessons, that she now provides for his grandchildren, Phyllis and Jock. Both love him dearly and called him by the nickname 'Gardy', but they do not know he is their grandfather. He hits upon an idea to provide them with an independent income for life, by buying four ships for his company from owner Joe Pillin for £60,000, and taking a 10 percent kickback in the form of a trust to be deposited by Pillin for his grandchildren. The £6,000 will provide £60 income per quarter for life and make them independent. Pillin reluctantly agrees because he must get rid of the ships due to slack business, but he senses it is unethical. Heythorpe railroads the sale through at a shareholder's meeting despite some minor opposition; Pillin delivers the notorized trust and the deal is done. But Ventner finds out about it through Pillin's lawyer and threatens to expose the deal to the shareholders unless the debt to him is paid in full. \"Pillin can spend his money any way he wants to,\" says Heythorpe, as he still refuses to pay the debt. Ventner replies that since Pillin didn't know his grandchildren, a trust in their name by him will surely outrage the shareholders. After Ventner leaves in a huff, Heythorpe mutters to himself \"He won't get the chance.\"","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Alfred E.

It involves stowing away on a passenger ship and leaving behind their beloved dog Laddy, a move they consider bittersweet. They seem somewhat apprehensive concerning their pact. Aboard the ship, a young man named Tom Prior, who seems to like his booze a little too much, has a feeling that something about the sailing is rather queer as everyone to who he speaks seems not to remember with who they are meeting or where they are going. The only exception is elderly socialite Mrs. Cliveden-Banks, who is off to meet her husband, Bunny. The only other passengers aboard are Catholic priest Reverend William Duke, wealthy business owner Mr. Lingley for who Tom used to work, and an uneducated working class elderly woman named Mrs. Midget. The only crew member is Scrubby, the steward. Tom eventually deciphers the nature of their trip, quicker than most that have taken it before have done. Before they reach their final destination, they each meet with a man named Thompson to discuss their life. Henry and Ann also want to meet with Thompson to take their pact to its intended conclusion, which may not be possible since they are not officially on the passenger list.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"40","tomatoUserRating":"3.5","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"Robert Milton","Released":"29 Nov 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"83 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"92","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Outward Bound","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Sutton Vane (by), J.

Claire wants to get married. But, Stoddard, whom she cares for very much, has several proposals directed at her, none of which sound remotely like a marriage proposal; Claire tells him, in her straight-forward, no-nonsense manner that she wants to get married because, in her words: \"I'm running away from the doubts and uncertainty and problems of a woman who isn't married.\" Stoddard thinks that nuptial bonds is a stupid old-fashioned tradition and fatal to romance. She says any man who says that is lying, and when she departs his suite at the crack of dawn, she seems convinced Stoddard indeed believes what he said he believed. But Claire has another option awaiting her...a Texan from home, and she promptly accepts his marriage proposal. But the house detective comes along after the ceremony and tells Tex his version of what he thinks goes on when a woman stays in a man's suite until the crack of dawn, and that doesn't jibe with his definition of a moral woman, and he ups and leaves her. Stoddard comes along and he thinks Tex has made a mockery of the marriage vows he took a short while ago, and he tells Claire that he will marry her, as soon as she can get an annulment from that day's ceremony, and they will make a go of it because they are 'different.' Somewhere in the 24-hour setting of this film, Claire plays a piano and sings a song called \"In My Dreams, You Still Belong To Me,\" and then does a tango with a partner; and then does a solo-dance performance, interpreting a bullfighter...in costume...in 2-strip Technicolor.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Marcel De Sano","Released":"10 Jan 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"63 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Peacock Alley","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Carey Wilson (story), Wells Root (scenario), Frances Hyland (scenario), Carey Wilson (dialogue)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Charles has a horrible reputation for being a gambler and a ladies' man. Sir Peter hates Charles and loves his brother Joseph. Rawley loves Charles and hates his brother Joseph. Sir Oliver is coming to town secretly with the help of Rawley in order to see which of his nephews is worthy of his money. Sir Peter and Lady Teazle are having a hard time with their marriage because she is very young and he is older. Lady Sneerwell is plotting with Snake and Joseph to make Sir Peter think that Lady Teazel is having an affair with Charles, so that Maria will not love Charles so Lady Sneerwell can marry Charles and Joseph can marry Maria. The play really starts to go crazy when Sir Oliver arrives. He wants to test his nephews and see what kind of people they are so he has sent a letter from an imaginary distant relative, Mr. Stanley, asking for money. When Sir Oliver arrives he pretends to be a money lender, Mr. Premium. He goes to Charles and offers to buy all the portraits of his ancestors. Charles will sell all the portraits except the one of Sir Oliver. This pleases Sir Oliver and he then sets out to test Joseph. He goes to Joseph and pretends to be Mr. Stanley, asking for money.

She comes over, but suddenly Sir Peter shows up. Lady Teazle hides behind a screen while Joseph tells Sir Peter that Charles is not having an affair with his wife. Charles comes and Sir Peter hides in a box so that he can hear that Charles is not guilty. Joseph also tells Sir Peter that he has a French lady behind the screen.

Then Joseph has to go out to deal with another guest. Sir Peter and Charles decide to look at the French girl that Joseph has in his house. They pull down the screen and Joseph comes back just in time to see that Lady Teazle has been revealed to Sir Peter. They all stand in silence until Lady Teazle tells Sir Peter how touched she is by all the things he said while she was hiding. They vow to improve the marriage. The gossips of the town try to decide if it was Joseph or Charles who was having the affair with Lady Teazle. They all come together at Joseph's house and Sir Oliver reveals himself.

Florence loves Walter, but insists upon moving to a new apartment and refurnishing it to minimize that interference. They marry and live happily, especially when Walter sends his 7-year-old son, Junior, to a school in Switzerland so they can start their marriage by being alone. But some time later Walter gets a cablegram telling him that Junior is deathly ill from typhoid fever, and asking him to come quickly. He decides to do so without consulting Florence, who is now pregnant and expecting her baby any moment. She tells him she won't have him when he comes back, because he did not consider her feelings. The boy survives, and he and Walter return, but Florence considers her marriage over and decides to leave with Gilbert even though she doesn't love him. Gilbert, however, doesn't want her new baby to come with them, putting her in a quandry as to what to do.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Russell Mack","Released":"09 Feb 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"1 h 4 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Second Wife","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"F.

Bosko drives his anthropomorphic car to the home of his girlfriend, Honey. The two go for a ride, but the way is blocked by a haughty cow. Bosko pushes her body down under her legs, which stick up like tent poles, and drives over her. All is sunny and bright for Bosko and Honey until they lose control of the car.

The horse doesn't seem to know it either. First rattle out of the box, Bob, now riding Starlight,gets into trouble the next day when the stagecoach arrives, as the horse is identified as the one rode by the leader, Butch Coleman, of the bandits who held up the stage.

Some volunteer out of a sense of duty while others travel to France because that's where all the men are. The nurses are surrounded by death and disease and must sacrifice their own comfort and safety in service of the wounded men who need them. The soldiers, so far from home and facing an uncertain future, are desperate for female companionship, but not necessarily the kind of romance the nurses are hoping for. Pretty young Joy hits it off with Robin, a fellow New Yorker, while no-nonsense Barbara tries to fend off the advances of Wally, a cocksure young flier. Joy's wartime romance takes an unexpected turn, with serious consequences, and Barbara reconsiders her romantic notions when Wally is sent on a dangerous mission.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Edgar Selwyn","Released":"22 Nov 1930","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"81 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"War Nurse","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Becky Gardiner (continuity), Becky Gardiner (dialogue), Joseph Farnham (dialogue)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English, French","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

They plan on selling him the one across the way from Hutter's own home. Hutter leaves his innocent wife, Ellen, with some friends while he is away. Hutter's trek is an unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, which most attribute to the plague. Hutter himself tries to rush home to save his town and most importantly save Ellen from Nosferatu's imminent arrival. In Wisbourg, Ellen can feel the impending darkness as Nosferatu gets closer. But she learns that a sinless woman can sacrifice herself to kill the vampire. Will Hutter be able to save Ellen either from Nosferatu and/or her self-sacrifice?","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Horror","Awards":"1 nomination.","Director":"F.W.

He later finds the family home in ruins and his father dying---the result of an attack by the same three men; \"Black\" Kelly, Ike Mason and Al Goss. Joaquin goes to a mining camp to inform his brother, Juan, of the murder and, on his way, he meets Helen Lake, who has come west to teach in the town school. Determined to get possession of the rich Murietta claim, Kelly, Mason and Goss attack the camp, kill Juan and beat Joaquin into unconsciousness. But even with the Murietta claim in their possession these men do not prosper long. A mysterious bandit, known as \"The Black Shadow\", continually raids the stage coach which carries shipments of their ore. Captain Lake of the United States Army, who is Helen's father, offers a reward of $5,000 for the capture of \"The Black Shadow\", but Joaquin's disguise is too effective and he eludes capture. He posts a placard in the local saloon threatening Kelly, Mason and Goss with death... and then manages to carry out the threat without committing bloodshed himself; Kelly is inadvertently shot by Goss and Goss also hits Mason while firing wildly at \"The Black Shadow.\" Goss gets his when Joaquin forces him to wear the costume of \"The Black Shadow\" and is shot down by a mob. Columbia remade this in 1942 as the last entry in the studio's eight-film series starring Bill Elliott and Tex Ritter, with Elliott in the Murietta role and Ritter in a revised version of the \"Captain Lake\" role, minus the daughter.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Romance, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Roy William Neill","Released":"06 Mar 1931","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"72 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Avenger","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"George Morgan (screenplay), Jack Townley (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The parrot laughs so hard he falls off his branch and into a dead tree trunk shaped like a tube. When he comes out, his feathers have been torn off. Bosko soon has worse troubles than a mocking parrot. A lion chases him. Bosko is saved by an alligator when the lion accidentally jumps into its mouth. But Bosko is not safe yet.

He answers the phone himself by knocking off the receiver and barking into the speaker. Honey asks Bruno to wake up Bosko, so the dog tries again. Even the phone does its part by sprouting hands and arms, which it uses to whistle and knock its receiver on the floor. Bosko finally answers and tells Honey he'll be right over. When Bosko arrives at Honey's place, the two of them sing and dance and play music. The kitten expresses its disdain by dumping bathwater into Bosko's saxophone, but Bosko continues to play as bubbles emerge from the bell. Honey dances on the soap bubbles, safely descending from her balcony to the ground as they pop. The kitten is soon forgotten as Bosko and Honey go for a bicycle ride, followed by Bruno.

He covers up his crime, becomes president of the bank and is the leader of a small army of gunmen oppressing the ranchers of Comanche County. Curt Fremont rides in to investigate his brother's murder, and convinces Kildare that he is a harmless, brainless, worthless, no-account lazy drifter--- and might even be a sissy or a fop ---so Kildare decides he isn't worth the trouble of having him killed.Curt's pose also does nothing to impress rancher's daughter Mary Lou Moran as day-by-day he does nothing but lay around and eat and sleep and ignore Mary Lou, and Mary Lou is not use to being ignored. But... night after night, Curt rides out in a Mexican costume as a bandit called \"El Capitan\" and harasses Kildare's business enterprises to the point of becoming a nuisance. Kildare offers a reward for the capture of \"El Capitan.\" Curt, as \"El Capitan\" captures himself, robs Kildare of the reward money and turns it over Senora Conares, a Mexican woman whom Kildare has reduced to poverty.While Kildare and his henchies are out of town on a mission to attach the cattle belonging to Mary Lou's father, Curt has all the citizens busily firing at a shack where \"El Capitan\" is supposedly hiding, while he saunters over to the bank and steals the account books, which prove that Kildare is a crook. He captures Kildare's accomplice, Tom Vache, in the murder of his brother, forces a confession from him and takes him to Sheriff Jim Burke, to whom Curt has already turned over the bank's books. Kildare, in an escape attempt, is thrown from his horse and almost falls over a cliff, but Curt ropes him and turns him over to the sheriff. Along the way, George Mendoza plays \"La Paloma\" on a guitar just to reinforce the \"Zorro\" theme.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Romance, Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Otto Brower","Released":"01 Apr 1931","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"61 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Clearing the Range","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Jack Cunningham (story), Jack Natteford (screenplay)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

She is involved with Ah Kee, a handsome young man, who also unbeknownst to her, is a secret agent out to thwart the heinous plots of Fu Manchu. As it turns out, Fu is not only her next-door neighbor, he is also, (unbeknownst to her), her father. When she finds out, will she take her father's part and fight the men out to get Fu, or will she become a brave heroine and save the world even if it is from the devious doings of her own Dad? Yes, it's dated, and there isn't nearly enough of Warner Oland in it; but it moves along well, has a lot of action, Wong and Hayakawa were fine actors, and if you're a Charley Chan fan, it's worth it to how much, if any, of Fu Oland used when creating Charley Chan.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"17","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Lloyd Corrigan","Released":"05 Sep 1931","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"70 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"437","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Daughter of the Dragon","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Lloyd Corrigan (adaptation), Monte M.

Among his guests are the wealthy Spruce Meadows and his daughter Susan. But the West isn't wild anymore and most of Carr's guests are bored and about to leave. He is in despair when a caravan carrying a broke-down-and-out troupe of actors---Jennifer, Judd, Mrs. Merridew and her daughter, Alice---crashes down the hill and wrecks the hotel sign. Carr offers to board and lodge them free for a week if they can provide enough excitement to keep Meadows and the other guest from leaving. The actors agree. They have the properties and costumes for a Western melodrama,\"Vance Kilroy's Revenge\", which they proceed to adapt real-life for the occasion. That evening a woman (Mrs. Merridew) rushes into the hotel lounge with her little daughter (Alice), begging to be saved from the whip of her brutal husband Black Jud (Judd). He comes after them with a whip but the heroic Vance Kilroy (Jenifer) arrives and saves them. Black Jed leaves, shaking his fists, trimming his mustache and vowing to return. The visitors swallow the hoax, and dedcide to return. Jenifer (as Vance Kilroy) falls in love with Susan, but she sees through his false baravado and snubs him. A gang of bandits, planning to rob the local bank, arrives as hotel guests. Burson, the \"ladies' man\" dandy of the group takes a shine to Susan. When \"Black Jed\" returns, he is pursued and \"strangled\" by \"Kilroy\" but Burson openly shows his disbelief in the hero. Having being \"killed\" as \"Black Jed\", Judd re-appears the next morning as a Sioux Indian chief. When the bank robbery is committed, one of the gang wears a costume similar to Jennifers, and suspicion is cast on him. Sheriff Simonson arrives and arrests Jennifer, but Alice sees the bandits kidnap Susan, and she convinces the wooden-headed sheriff that he has arrested the wrong man. Jennifer joins the posse in pursuit of the fleeing gangsters. The ads, in London, carried a blurb from the Sunday Times reviewer in which he called the film... \"Quite the funniest and brainest satire of American cowboy Wild West stuff I have ever seen...\" \"Ruggles of Red Gap\" in 1935 probably knocked him for a loop.

This one has Andy's father dying in the desert and Cody comes along and adopts him or something.

Because of his wealth, he can have any woman on his arms. Currently that role is filled by Marcelle Dubrey, but Jack ditches her when he spots the woman of his dreams. When Jack tells his equally wealthy friend Michael Cummins that he will marry that mystery woman, Michael, upon learning that that woman is Lu Lu Carroll who he too has been trying to court, bets Jack $50,000 that he can't give up all his money and get engaged to her within two weeks. Jack accepts the bet as Mike strips him of his money. Jack has to try and meet and woo her all without doing anything with her that requires money, all the while trying to hide the fact that he has no money as he tries to earn some using whatever limited job skills he has at hand. Meanwhile, Mike hires a couple of American detectives, Simon Johanssen and Peter Swanson, to tail Jack to ensure that he keeps to the rules of the bet, but also to thwart Jack's attempts with Lu Lu at any turn. What Mike is unaware of is that they are poor schmucks who are rather inept at being detectives.

Unknown to the theater going public and despite being married for only six months, that magic seems no longer to translate to their personal life, where they are constantly arguing, even under their breaths during on-stage curtain calls. These arguments stem from the actress' moody behavior, which the actor believes means that she no longer loves him and that she is looking for another man to replace him in her personal life. He believes she even scans the audience for potential suitors, probably being most attracted to the soldier type. Their feuding is at a point where they take pot shots at each other about everything in their lives, even the quality of the other's acting. The actor may have a valid point as the actress has been receiving bouquets of roses of late and a Russian guardsman has been seen hanging around outside their home. The actor knows these things as he is that Russian guardsman (who is also a Russian prince) in disguise, he who is also sending the flowers as the guardsman. He wants to see if this guardsman can indeed woo his wife away from him, and thus show her for who she really is. He concocts a further scheme to pretend to be out of town for a 24 hour period on another acting engagement, during which time he will try and seduce her as the guardsman. But the actress may throw some wrenches into his plan.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.2","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars.

Walking along the saloon porch, they overhear through an open window, two unseen men plotting to rob the Mesa bank that afternoon. One is a Spanish voice and the other American. Dave and Hank head for Mesa to get there before the hold-up and, there, they see the men whose voices they had heard; Sheriff Jeffries and Ortego. Since they have an hour to kill before the (announced) hold-up time, while Hank ambles toward the saloon Dave decides to make a social call on his sweetheart, Ann. But she is now his ex-sweetheart as she tells him that because of his unexplained absence, she has become engaged to Sheriff Jeffries. Dang, says Dave. Anyway, to foil the planned hold-up Dave and Hank hold up the bank themselves and ride out of town closely pursued by a posse. The gold is heavy so Dave tells Hank to ride on while he buries it. The sheriff, riding ahead of the posse with a vested interest in the going-ons, sees Dave hide the gold. The sheriff captures Dave, sends him back to town with the posse, and stays behind to retrieve the gold. He does so but is seen by Hank who comes along and takes the fourth possession (counting the bank) of the gold that day. The sheriff is about to let an angry mob hang Dave, but fickle Ann slaps the Sheriff and tells the mob that if they hang Dave, they'll never see their gold again, since the last known possessor was the now, unknown to him, the twice-removed Dave. The sheriff is caught between a rock and a hard place and can't tell the mob he knows where it is, or thinks he knows where it is since he doesn't know he is now a once-removed possessor himself. The sheriff hatches a plan to let Dave escape but he has three of Ortego's henchmen planted to kill Dave in his escape. They miss. Dave rides to Alkali Springs and meets Hank and Ann and all three are taken prisoner by Ortego just before the sheriff shows up. But they tell Ortego that the sheriff has double-crossed him and has the gold hidden under the floor of his office. The sheriff scoffs at this because he thinks the gold is still buried in the desert, so he has no objections when Ortego says he and Pedro will just ride back over to Mesa and check out this story, and he tells the rest of the gang to follow later and bring Dave, Ann, Hank and the Sheriff back to Mesa.When they get there they find a mad Ortego holding an empty gold box he found under the office floor and the Sheriff is as surprised as Ortego is angry. Ortego and the Sheriff call each other a few names in Spanish and English, conclude that the other one is a double crosser and up and shoot each other dead. Dave then discloses that he is a deputy United States Marshal sent out to break up the Ortego gang. He then decides to ask Ann some questions regarding absence makes the heart grow fonder.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Lloyd Nosler","Released":"09 Sep 1931","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"61 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Man from Death Valley","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"George Arthur Durlam (story), Lloyd Nosler (story)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Defending her at her trial is Dick Grady, a lawyer who has wasted his talent on alcohol. When he proves Carlotta's innocence, however, he regains respect and employment. Dick goes to Carlotta's apartment to thank her, and arrives just in time to keep her from committing suicide. He agrees that while the persona of Carlotta must die, the woman inside must go on and start anew. Loaning her his advance money, Carlotta and Dick create a new identity for her as \"Ann Trevor,\" and she moves to New York. Through various letters and repayment checks, Dick learns that Carlotta is happy and successful and falls in love with her. He relocates to New York, where Carlotta is employed as an interior decorator and is engaged to wealthy Larry Gordon. Carlotta is happy to see Dick again, but is dismayed to learn that he is in love with her. Dick believes she is deceiving Larry because she does not intend to tell him of her past. Carlotta is introduced to Larry's family and discovers that Larry's uncle is Roger Metcalf, Dick's employer from Panama. Dick visits at the same time and tells Carlotta's story, but informs them that Carlotta \"killed\" herself. Unable to conceal the truth any longer, Carlotta confesses her past, and although Larry and his mother try to be understanding, the engagement is broken. One year later, Carlotta is assigned to decorate the house that Larry originally bought for their marriage and finds that Dick has purchased it. Carlotta finally admits her love for Dick, and after accepting his marriage proposal, they enter their new home together.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"George Abbott","Released":"03 Oct 1931","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"80 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"My Sin","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"George Abbott (adaptation), Owen Davis (screenplay), Adelaide Heilbron (screenplay), Frederick J.

Saunders tells his problem to Phil Lee, a prosperous young rancher, whose method of settling problems has gained him the nickname of \"Quick Trigger.\" Lee ambles over to the Wales office and battles it out with Jeremy's son, Sam, and two henchmen and comes away with the note. Leaving the office, he rescues a girl from what is apparently a holdup and subsequent run-away team --- only to find that he has interrupted a scene which a motion picture company is filming. Rose Campbell, the actress in the scene, is impressed anyway and invites him to a dance at the hotel. Sam Wales has already met Rose and isn't too happy about seeing Lee with her. In a moonlight conversation, Rose tells Lee that she is searching for her grandfather, who she has not seen since her mother's death when Rose was a young child.She says his name is John Saunders and Lee says he knows him well, and Rose says take me to him after I change clothes and Lee says okay. While Rose is changing clothes, Sam and his two henchmen capture Lee and tie him up. Sam, driving a touring car longer than an 18-wheeler trailer, meets Rose and says he will take her to her grandfather because Lee is tied up and, besides that, Lee is just a two-bit swindler out to beat her old granpappy out of his mine. Rose buys that and gets in his convertible bus.

Both were produced (for Big 4) by a company named Hooper-Connell Corp.,Ltd, which was cameraman R.B. Hooper and brothers Robert and Charles T. Connell. Hooper shot both films, David Kirkland wrote and directed both and Charles T. Connell edited both, minus a credit line. Common mistakes regarding both films is that an elder actor named Joe Lawliss was in both (and billed as such) but some source has evidently decided Joe Lawliss didn't know how to spell his own name and has incorrectly changed it to Joe Lawless. Some source also thinks that the Don Wilson credited in both films is the same Don Wilson that was the announcer on the Jack Benny radio and television programs. He ain't. Etta Delmas is in both films (same cast in both) but some source has decided that her role in \"Flying Lariats\" was played by an actress that doesn't exist named Etta Dalsing. Well, she didn't exist until said source created her. The plot of \"Riders of the Cactus\" must have taken four of the seven shooting days as it is more involved than the one in \"Flying Lariats.\" This one revolves around an old Latin parchment which holds the secret to the location of a buried Spanish treasure. American tourist Josie Casey and her Aunt Sarah come into possession of the document, but transposing Latin is neither's strong suit, which need not be meant to imply that acting was. But Jake McKeever/Jake Wenzel does and intends to acquire it. He has his wife Pearl (Tete Brady), bar girl wearing a one-piece bathing suit or corset or something but making whatever it is look really good, distract Border Patrolman Bob Bronson while Jake gets the document from the Caseys. Jake and his gang head for the Sonoran desert. They are followed by a prospector leading a blanket-covered mule train. Jake and his men are a little miffed when Border Patrolmen and Mexican Rurales come out from under the blankets. There were several of these Hopper-McConnell westerns shot over a short period of time, and a few of them appear like they mixed up some reels in the editing process, as character names and situations sometimes change in a New York minute. But that doesn't account for the Joe Lawless/Etta Delsing/Don Wilson errors. Those have been created in the past few years.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Western","Awards":"N/A","Director":"David Kirkland","Released":"07 Jul 1931","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"1 h","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Riders of the Cactus","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Charles Connell, David Kirkland","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

There, they meet storekeeper Ma Warren(Florence Turner) and her pretty daughter Sally(Frances Morris) and Steve and Harry start vieing for her attentions, with Steve in the lead after he sings \"I Fell in Love With You\" to her, and Harry hasn't much to counter with as Sally is not a trinket-favoring girl.But not all is well, for Sally's brother Bud is also part of the family storekeeping business, when he isn't pulling robberies in near-by towns with his accented partner Nikkos, and he begins to fret over the possibility that Steve and Harry will learn that he was part of the affair in the other town that led to Steve and Harry's hasty departure.

Chief among the latter is spending time across the railroad tracks in Shantytown, instead of playing with \"clean\" neighborhood kids like brother and sister Sidney and Eloise. Skippy's father, Dr. Herbert Skinner, the city's head of the health board, in particular doesn't like Skippy spending time there as Dr. Skinner is a verminophobe, and believes Shantytown is dirty and unhealthy. On Skippy's latest visit to Shantytown when he meets a new friend named Sooky Wayne, he learns that Shantytown is being torn down and its poor residents have to move. And Sooky's mongrel and unlicensed (since Mrs. Wayne can't afford the $3 license fee) dog Penny is captured by the city's dog catcher. As Skippy does whatever he can to raise the $3 to get Penny back for his new friend (which includes breaking into his piggy bank, holding a variety show for the Shantytown kids, and trying to ask his father for the money), Skippy learns that one person seems to be responsible for both these problems in his life, which makes the already tenuous relationship with this person even more tenuous.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"100","tomatoUserRating":"3.3","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Family, Drama, Comedy","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar.

Nancy learns from husband and wife Billy and Sally Ross - Don's business partner and Don's sister - that Don is with his mistress, Peggy Preston, who he intends to marry if Nancy will grant him a divorce. Apparently, everyone is aware of the situation and most, including Billy and Sally and the household servants, are on Nancy's side. After composing herself following receiving this devastating news, Nancy, who still loves Don and wants to be with him, decides that there are better ways of getting him back than to be the devastated wife.
