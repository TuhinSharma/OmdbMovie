The Duke and Steve fight again, and everyone rushes out of the cave. Mr. Rockface notices his pot of food is empty; earlier, Wild Willie the Missing Link had eaten it. Mr. Rockface tells the three suitors they will have to procure their own dinner. Steve locates a desert quail and shoots an arrow at it, but the arrow misses the quail and happily (for Steve) hits The Duke's behind. Meanwhile, Wild Willie is still hungry and goes hunting for snakes. He finds a dinosaur's tail instead, and when he tries to eat it the dinosaur kills him. Luckily, Theophilus witnesses this scene; after the dinosaur leaves he stands on the dead monkey-man, as if triumphant. The others arrive and are shocked that Theophilus apparently has slain the terror of the countryside.

Conchita, his wife who he loves above everything else in the world, dies leaving an infant daughter, Pamela. Rameau is inconsolable and keeps the room that Conchita died in inviolate, visiting it only on the anniversary of his wife's death. Twenty years later on one of these visits he discovers, among one of Conhita's letters, proof that she had been unfaithful to him and that Pamela, the girl he had raised from an infant to womanhood, was not his child. The shock drives him out of his mind, and he drives Pamela from his home, refusing to ever see her again. Dr. Talavanne, his best friend, informs him that Pamela is dying and only Rameau's skills as a physician can save her.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Will S.

The charming canine happily performs them, plus a few mischievous ones of his own, including engaging Dud in a little dance and tying up the boy with his leash. Later, while Wag has a semi-friendly encounter with a cat, Dud spies an old gentleman smoking a pipe. The gentleman falls asleep and Dud steals the pipe. \"Here's where I make Pittsburgh look like a million dollars worth of sunshine!\" he tells his dog. He smokes the pipe and his exhalations form the face of the old gentleman, then a beautiful woman, then the words, \"You're a bad boy.\" Dud laughs at this, but then the smoke turns into a demon-like spirit who aims to fix him good. The spirit grabs Dud and lifts him high into the air. The distraught Wag is soon up to his neck in a flood of his own tears. Meanwhile, the spirit hooks Dud onto an unfriendly crescent moon. Dud cheers up the moon by telling him a joke, but the moon laughs so hard that he knocks off Dud, who falls back to earth.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Animation, Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Wallace A.

He takes the coat and locket belonging to the little Princess and then sends his own daughter, Hildegarde, away. During the abduction of Gretchen she is wounded in the shoulder by a bullet. Fifteen years later Von Herbeck tells the Grand Duke he has found the Princess, and produces the coat, locket and Hildegarde as proof. Meanwhile, the real Princess has been abandoned by the gypsies and adopted by peasants, and has grown up as a \"Goose Girl.\" The young King Fredrick of Jugendheit is officially betrothed to the fake Princess but he does not wish to marry a woman he has never met. He disguises himself as a Vinter and travels around the countryside, meets the Goose Girl, and rescues her from the insulting attentions of a vicious Count, and longs to marry her.

The picture opens with our hero riding a mule through a creek bed, when he is set upon by some robbers. Gussle outsmarts them by attempting to hand over his goods by stretching across the stream, but dropping the goods into the water thereby making the robber also fall in. He makes his way to an inn and recounts his experiences to the other guests and then they all go out and spend time playing in the snow. Some trick photography is used to make it appear that Gussle is making a mule walk backwards.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Charles Avery, Syd Chaplin","Released":"03 May 1915","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"10 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Gussle's Backward Way","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Mack Sennett","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Hart) and \"Wind River\" (Herschel Mayall) are robbed, at gunpoint. After the surprise, they track Maitland down, and Keno shoots him dead on self defense. Keno goes through his belongings and finds a letter and a locket; the letter announces the arrival of the deceased's sister, and the locket has a cameo picture of Doris Maitland (Margaret Thompson). Thus, Keno tells Wind River they must do a heap of lying. Meeting the girl at the stagecoach's arrival, Keeno feels responsible for the innocent and attractive Ms. Maitland; he tells her a white lie, that her brother was a good man, \"killed in a mine accident,\" who had left her a cabin and money - and Keno turns his own cabin over to Doris. Keno and Doris began to fall in love. Anita (Louise Glaum), a dance-hall girl, aggressively tries to seduce Keno. Keno repels her, and later, the dance-hall girl catches sight of her rival when Keno muses on the cameo. Anita decides to expose his lies to Doris in a private conversation at the cabin. First, Doris gets into a fight with the saloon girl but then Doris accepts the painful truth. Furious, Doris confronts Keno outdoors, and his admission of having killed her brother is followed by her sending a bullet into his body. Keno, disillusioned, wounded, staggers back to the Double Stamp, asking Wind River for his saddle bags so he can ride out. But not far from town, as he lays dying, Wind River tells Doris all the facts about her brother. They find Keno, and Doris nurses him back to health.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Crime, Romance","Awards":"N/A","Director":"William S.

He is greatly impressed when his friend, Dr. Pennison Crisp, successfully grafts a paw from one cat onto another. Mortmain's engagement to Bella Forsythe is complicated by the fact that she is the ward of his friend, banker Gordon Russell, to whom he owes money. Worse, Russell is also in love with Bella. Russell causes Bella's brother, Tom Forsythe, to disgrace himself, and forces Mortmain into bankruptcy. Mortmain rashly says that he would like to kill Russell, but this is overheard by Flaggs, who works for Russell's lawyer. Mortmain then hears that Russell has been murdered, and in shock he faints and injures his hand. Dr. Crisp anesthetizes Mortmain with ether, which causes hallucinations, and creepily tells him that although he must amputate the hand, another can be grafted in its place. Tom Forsythe, who is suspected of the murder, agrees to Crisp's offer of $10,000, but dies during the transplant. Crisp now grafts Tom's hand onto Mortmain's arm. Mortmain gradually goes insane as Flaggs blackmails him and Bella is now afraid to be touched by him. The hand goes crazy! Mortmain awakens from his ether-induced dream to find that Tom's hand is choking Flaggs...","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Theodore Marston","Released":"06 Sep 1915","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Mortmain","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Marguerite Bertsch, Arthur Chesney Train","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

The pair pay another visit to a pub, then make their way to their hotel. They become interested in a pretty young woman staying in the room across the hall, but when Charlie spies on her through the keyhole a bellboy makes him stop. Charlie is taken aback to realize that the young woman's husband is the head waiter from the restaurant. He promptly checks out and moves to another hotel. Meanwhile, the head waiter and his wife, dissatisfied with the service, also decide to move to another hotel-- and, unfortunately, choose the same one Charlie has chosen, and once more wind up in the room across the hall from him. When the young woman's dog runs into Charlie's room she follows in her pajamas.

In it, Oxilia spins a variation on the Faust myth, embodied here by the diva Lyda Borelli. Typical of extravagant D'Annunzian aestheticism at its height, Rapsodia Satanica was one of the summits of what was later called the \"tail coat film.\" Diametrically opposed to the \"cinema of reality\" practiced by Serena, Martoglio and others, \"tail coat films\" set their melodramatic stories in the salons and villas of the upper middle class and the aristocracy, deploying narrative structures contrived to showcase their actors and especially its actresses. This had the effect of accentuating their physical presence and turning them into stars - probably the first stars in movie history. The success of the \"dive\" contributed to the development of motion picture grammar in its special use of the close-up.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.4","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Drama, Fantasy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Nino Oxilia","Released":"01 Jul 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"40 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"18","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Italy","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Satan's Rhapsody","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Alberto Fassini (screenplay), Alberto Fassini (story), Fausto Maria Martini (poem)","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"75"}
