Years later, long after she has left Ambrose, Jane falls in love with Richard Newton, whose own past, like hers, hardly stands out as scrupulous. They get married and have a child, but then Richard finds out that Jane had been a kept woman, and insists on a separation. He soon begins to think about his own past indiscretions, however, and realizes the hypocrisy of judging Jane by a higher standard than the one by which he has lived. As a result, he asks her forgiveness, and she eagerly takes him back.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Cleo Madison","Released":"24 Jan 1916","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"A Soul Enslaved","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Adele Farrington, Olga Printzlau (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

On a walk, they meet some gypsies, who show Sally a \"magical ring.\" Giles buys it for her, and Sally comes to believe in its power when her wishes -- such as for a new dress and shoes to wear to the Earl's party for the villagers -- come true, although actually Giles is responsible. At the party, Sally accidentally discovers the note from the Earl and realizes who Giles really is. She determines to reconcile father and son, and begins visiting the Earl each day to play chess and distract him from the pain he suffers from gout. The gypsies tell her that she can find an herbal cure at Devil's Cliff, but when Sally doesn't return home, a search party finds her lying unconscious by the herb. The Earl is upset to hear of her accident and goes to visit her; when his horse goes lame in the village, he unwittingly borrows one from his own son for half a crown.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"Maurice Tourneur","Released":"09 Nov 1914","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"54 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Wishing Ring: An Idyll of Old England","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Owen Davis (play), Maurice Tourneur (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

Her father refuses to let him marry her, though, unless Lopaka can bring him two feather cloaks from a rare bird. While searching the mountains for the bird, Lopaka encounters a dying priest of Pele who sells him a wishing bottle in which Kono, the god of the volcanos, is confined. The priest warns him of the dangers of the bottle: if he dies still owning it, he will be damned, and the only way to get rid of it is to sell it for a price smaller than was paid for it. Lopaka agrees and wishes to be rich, then marries Kokua and sells the bottle. All is well until Lopaka contracts leprosy. To get rid of it, he must acquire the bottle again, and he is forced to buy it for the smallest coin of the realm! To save her husband's soul, Kokua is ready to sacrifice herself by buying the bottle for a smaller French coin. Fortunately, a wicked sailor appears with a still smaller Chinese coin and becomes its final owner when the bottle is lost at sea. Lopaka's wealth vanishes, but he is happy to be with Kokua.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Fantasy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Marshall Neilan","Released":"26 Mar 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"50 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Bottle Imp","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Charles Maigne, Robert Louis Stevenson (short story \"The Bottle Imp\")","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

He and his partner, Peter Clay, modeled the dummy after a janitor in their building. While the inventor's daughter is in love and engaged to Clay, the janitor pines for the daughter. A misunderstanding breaks up the partnership, and Tinker forbids his daughter from marrying his now ex-partner. But the daughter hopes a possible lucrative purchase of the dummy from a vaudeville company will be the impetus for her father and Clay to mend their differences, and for them again to be married. The janitor, who sees this rift as an opportunity, hatches his own plan to be near the one he loves, the plan which involves him taking the place of the dummy. Not wanting to blow his cover, the janitor keeps on masquerading as the dummy even after the sale to the vaudeville company. A life-like dummy with a mind of his own on the loose has its own consequences.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Short, Comedy","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Herman C.

Jimmie, who has always dreamed of becoming an inventor, goes to New York to sell the machine he invented, and there he renews his acquaintance with Claire. Soon their old friendship ripens into love. Meanwhile, back in the country, Ralph and David Harding, who are making Jimmie's machine, plan to steal the right to it. Back in New York, Mary appears and informs Claire that she loves Jimmie, and the actress resolves to give her a chance to win him. When it appears that the Hardings' scheme to steal Jimmie's machine will succeed, however, Mary's ardor turns cold. Claire and Jimmie then rush back to the country in time to avert the takeover and save his firm from bankruptcy.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Lambert Hillyer","Released":"05 Aug 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"50 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"An Even Break","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Lambert Hillyer","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

For his attempts he needs platinum, but the funds run out because the factory owner Van Haaften has lost his money in stock-speculations. Luckily for Jan, he finds a farewell letter in the park, including a large sum of money. Meanwhile, the owner's son Leo confesses his love for Jan's daughter Annie, but Van Haaften forbids their marriage. Because of Jan's nephew Willem Berg's ongoing spying attempts to gain knowledge of the secret recipe, Jan buys Van Haaften a gun to defend himself against the villain. One night, as Willem has secretly entered the factory, Van Haaften enters his office to find a letter from a friend with a sum of money, that is not nearly large enough to cover his losses. He writes a suicide note and shoots himself, after which Willem enters the office and steals the money and the note. When, on the following morning, Jan has finally succeeded in rediscovering the recipe and goes to show the result to Van Haaften, he finds him dead. With all circumstances against him, he is thrown in prison, but he manages to slip his daughter Lilly the just-discovered recipe. While Willem's attempts to gain hold of the recipe get more and more violent, Lilly tries to gather evidence of her father's innocence. When she has finally succeeded, she sends off a letter to her sister Annie, who by now is guarding the recipe. With the recipe she goes on her way to Lilly, but is chased by Willem...","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Maurits Binger","Released":"09 Mar 1917","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"70 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"Netherlands","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Secret of Delft","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}
