Walthall, Mae Marsh, Robert Harron","Plot":"A fascinating work of high artistry, \"Judith of Bethulia\" will not only rank as an achievement in this country, but will make foreign producers sit up and take notice. It has a signal and imperative message, and the technique displayed throughout an infinity of detail, embracing even the delicate film tinting and toning, marks an encouraging step in the development of the new art. Ancient in story and settings, it is modern in penetrative interpretation - it is a vivid history of one phase of the time it concerns, and is redemptive as well as relative, a lesson from one of those vital struggles that made and unmade nations as well as individuals, yet it is not without that inspiring influence that appeals powerfully to human sense of justice. The entire vigorous action of the play works up to the personal sacrifice of Judith of Bethulia, a perilous chance she takes for the sake of the lives and happiness of her people. She dares expose herself to overwhelming humiliation and dishonor in a challenge of beauty to strength, struggles through a conversion of sentiment that makes the high crisis more acute, and sets at defiance the \"better-death-than-dishonor\" platitude, escaping both through that all-conquering combination in a woman, great physical beauty joined to lofty intelligence. She enters upon a relation of constant peril - only delicate treatment saves the situation at times - abandons her native purity of conduct and dares her own undoing, yet the noble end justified the dangerous means, and she emerges idealized by her people, an apotheosis of splendid womanhood. Bethulia is a fortified town of Judea, guarding a hill pass through which an invading Assyrian army must march in order to enter Judea. In the town lives Judith, a devout young woman of lofty character and remarkable beauty, when the place is stormed by Holofernes at the head of a large army. The fighting before the gate brings into action an enormous number of soldiers on both sides, and those engines of war, such as the battering ram and catapult, which were used by the fighting male of other days under close condition of furious combat. One desperate assault after another is repelled, scaling ladders are thrown down, great rocks are showered upon the invaders, and the wonder is that they keep at it. The reason is that Holofernes has a way of torturing and killing unsuccessful captains. As officer had better die in the thick of battle than return with a confession of defeat. Holofernes is as merciless as nature to all who fail. The great leader's brutality of his captains when they do not succeed in carrying the fortress by storm indicates what the inhabitants of Bethulia may expect in the event of capture and serves to intensify the clash of character later on - it adds peril to the undertaking of Judith when she resolves to sacrifice herself for her people. Holofernes, after making a horrible example of defeated captains by frightful torture, resorts to strategy. His soldiers have seized the wells from which the inhabitants of Bethulia obtained their water supply, and their leader adopts waiting tactics, diverting himself with dancing girls to break the tedium. Bethulia is on the verge of famine, and the besieged are almost ready to surrender the fortress and all Judea to the spoilers, when Judith goes forth in her finest raiment, accompanied only by her maid, enters the Assryian camp and obtains an interview with the merciless Holofernes. Against his formidable strength, his brutal ferocity and cunning, his absolute power, are matched her fascinating personality directed by intelligence and hidden purpose. She is willing to carry \"her fault on her shoulders like a coronation mantle.\" The dangerous and difficult situation from this point to Judith's terrible triumph and the defeat of the invading Assyrians is pictured without loss of force or charm by extreme delicacy of treatment. Beauty is constantly asserted by almost reckless prodigality in the matter of costume, and by the appeal of delightful acting. The feminine sweetness and shyness of the lovely Judith are intensified by her advances and retreats in measuring her sex attractions against his formidable power. She is weakened at the critical moment by a sudden flame of passion and compassion aroused in her breast, but self-control returns at a thought of all that is at stake, the safety and happiness of thousands of her people, and she dares be all and do all that revolts her finer nature from a deep hatred of injustice and wrong meted out to her peace-loving kindred and friends, from a noble desire to preserve her country and the destinies of her race.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"3.3","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"D.W.

They get an astronomer to get his telescope out and see how the conditions are on the moon. He comes on with a big telescope and looks through it, finds everything in fine condition from earth to moon, so the party start out. As they rise and turn upside down then right side up, they start on their journey to the moon. They pass over a busy city, knocking down buildings and chimneys. After passing over the city they come in contact with the planet Saturn. Bump it, encircle it, and then on their way to the moon they ride through the air and see an old man coming out of the planet Mars. The anchor on the aeroplane accidentally catches the old man by the neck and carries him off. The old man tries to get away, and he sees Halley's comet coming along and he grabs hold of the tail of the comet and goes away. One of the men in the aeroplane sees him and takes out a lasso. With a couple of swings he catches the old man around the neck and drags him behind. At last the moon is reached. The man in the moon opens his mouth and they all go in. The party drop from top of the moon all in a heap. They get up, look around and a large bird comes in and lays an egg larger than itself and flies off. The travelers put the egg on a fire, which is burning nearby. The egg cracks and a lot of little birds are hatched. Suddenly a strange animal comes on the scene and eats the little birds one by one. The animal fills up and bursts.

Chapo, the little hunchback, sees him and lingers by the artist. Pedestrians come and go and push him aside, but the boy is oblivious to everything but the painter and his magic. The art of the painter arouses a great latent gift in the hunchback. He so strongly covets artist's materials in the store of a curio dealer that he tries to steal them and is caught. A kind padre, himself an artist, rescues him from the irate dealer and teaches him to draw and paint. One day in the mission garden he sees lovely Eleanor, who becomes the idol of his dreams, the inspiration of his brush. She has, unfortunately, given herself to the profligate, Arguello, who abandons her. Chapo takes her to his own poor quarters and cares for her. Two years later she dies, and the hunchback, still rising in the world of art, adopts the two-year-old daughter. The scene advances twenty years. Chapo, the once neglected and despised, is a giant in the world of Parisian art and the adopted daughter has grown to be a beautiful young woman. They return to the old home, and there is Arguello, living a cumberer of the ground in his old age of vice, cards and liquor. He still has eyes and be leers upon the fair young flower leaning on the arm of Chapo. The indignant old padre calls on Arguello exclaiming, \"she is your child.\" The shock and shame finally overcome him and he dies on the spot.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Drama, Short","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Colin Campbell","Released":"07 Apr 1913","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"N/A","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Vengeance Is Mine","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Lanier Bartlett","Production":"N/A","Language":"N/A","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

His angry father, the Earl, sends him a message: \"Never let me see you again until you have earned a half crown and proven yourself worthy of confidence.\" Giles meets Sally, the parson's daughter, who believes Giles to be the gardener. On a walk, they meet some gypsies, who show Sally a \"magical ring.\" Giles buys it for her, and Sally comes to believe in its power when her wishes -- such as for a new dress and shoes to wear to the Earl's party for the villagers -- come true, although actually Giles is responsible. At the party, Sally accidentally discovers the note from the Earl and realizes who Giles really is. She determines to reconcile father and son, and begins visiting the Earl each day to play chess and distract him from the pain he suffers from gout. The gypsies tell her that she can find an herbal cure at Devil's Cliff, but when Sally doesn't return home, a search party finds her lying unconscious by the herb. The Earl is upset to hear of her accident and goes to visit her; when his horse goes lame in the village, he unwittingly borrows one from his own son for half a crown.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Awards":"1 win.","Director":"Maurice Tourneur","Released":"09 Nov 1914","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"54 min","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"The Wishing Ring: An Idyll of Old England","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Owen Davis (play), Maurice Tourneur (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}

When Jim Denning proposes to her, she says she loves him but she must see the world first. Angrily he leaves her as she sits beside the fireplace, whose dreamy flames inspire her to tempt a knowledge of things unknown to her. Out into the world she goes, where she sees and learns many things but with pangs and heartache. At a vital moment when she is about to faint dead away, the faithful Jim arrives and catches her in his arms. Betty awakens to find it has all been just a dream, and faithful Jim has no problem convincing her of the full meaning of a home and that the world and its false promises are not for her.","Metascore":"N/A","tomatoMeter":"N/A","tomatoUserRating":"N/A","tomatoConsensus":"N/A","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Awards":"N/A","Director":"Phillips Smalley, Lois Weber","Released":"17 May 1915","Website":"N/A","tomatoRating":"N/A","Runtime":"N/A","Response":"True","tomatoUserReviews":"N/A","tomatoFresh":"N/A","Country":"USA","tomatoImage":"N/A","Title":"Betty in Search of a Thrill","BoxOffice":"N/A","DVD":"N/A","Writer":"Elsie Janis (story), Elsie Janis (scenario)","Production":"N/A","Language":"English","tomatoUserMeter":"N/A"}
